If the programs are run in oder they will produce similar results but numbers will change becasue the url's (data) will change.
Py 01 produce the inital link file which is called raw.
All other programs produce either a .txt, .csv, .file and the output can be seen.
The 09_json.py program produces a directory called data that inputs both the memo and carb dating files into it.
