bank deposits what about taxes Governments tax by debiting bank accounts Federal taxation works to reverse what the government did when it made payments When you write a check to the Treasury for taxes owed the Federal Reserve acting in its capacity as the Treasury’s bank will debit your bank’s reserve account for the amount of taxes Your bank will of course debit your bank account The net effect of paying your taxes then is the removal of previously created government currency in the form of a reduction in your bank’s reserve balance Banks act as agents in the addition & removal of the government’s currency into and back out of the economy Government payments create bank balances taxes reduce bank balances Government payments provide income to recipients taxes reduce spending power Government payments are what creates our base money supply taxation reduces our money supply for reasons explained in the following sections Doesnt the federal government need to collect taxes before it can invest for public purpose Doesnt the federal government need to collect taxes before it can invest for public purpose It’s actually the other way around: the currency we need to pay our taxes must first be spent into the economy by government – there’s no other way for us to get the currency we need to pay the tax Notice the logic Federal taxes return to the government the currency it first created Only the government can create its currency – we’d be thrown in jail if we tried! We simply cannot pay our federal taxes until we have obtained the government’s currency Since the US government will only accept US dollars in payment of taxes logically government spending has to happen first This is in fact what happens in modern monetary systems The government never needs our taxes before being able to make payments Of course all state and local governments being currency users like you and I do still need to collect taxes in order to spend The federal government is unique as the issuer of the nation’s currency If the government can just create money out of thin air why does it need to tax us If the government can just create money out of thin air why does it need to tax us Taxes ensure there is continual demand for the government’s currency so that the government can always find willing sellers when it pays Imagine a government that wants to create a brand new currency let’s call themxa0GreenBucks or GBs for short The governmentxa0recruits you to workxa0as a teacher earning 80000 GBs a year Would you accept this brand new currency as wages Can you buy food or a car with those GBs Could you use your GB income to get a house mortgage Probably not until somehow the government can get everyone in the economy to convert over to using it’s new currency! Now what happens if the government also imposes a property tax on every household and business that must be paid in GBs and they also established a Central Bank that would facilitate GB payments between all the nation’s banks Now almost everyone in the nation owes GBs to the government and will accept them in payments Your local bank will now happily write you a mortgage in GBs with that good government job since they now act as agents of the government’s currency and they know everyone will use it for deposits contracts and loans TAXES “DRIVE” THE CURRENCY Step two in the section How are national currencies created is critical By imposing a tax that must be paid using the government’s currency businesses and households all need to obtain that currency in order to pay the taxes they now owe This is a simple yet proven and reliable methodxa0for anyxa0government to establish a currency and ensure it has broad acceptance to enable the government to provision itself Countries can and do literally create new currencies overnight which are nationally accepted simply by requiring that all tax liabilities must now be paid with that currency In this sense we say that federal taxes “drive” demand for the currency In large economies we lose sight of this underlying feature and there are certainly other reasons that currencies of many countries can become widely adopted but in the long run it is likely that taxation must bexa0collectedxa0at some level in order toxa0maintain a stable currency Countries that struggle to impose or collect taxes will have a reduced capacity to issue currency to obtain resources and labor and to invest in the development of their nation but countries that maintain a stable accountable government with the ability to collect taxes will always be able to find people willing to work and businesses willing to sell goods and services in exchange for their currency What other purposes do federal taxes serve What other purposes do federal taxes serve Taxes create and maintain continual demand for the government’s currency but they can also be used to further public purpose in several ways TAXES HELP MANAGE THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY Taxes function to reduce spending power in the economy By reducing spendable income taxes take away purchasing and borrowing power which in turn can reduce sales and leave people unemployed By freeing up workers and business capacity to supply what the government needs taxes can be said to create “fiscal space” for the government to then buy the resources it needs using its currency If we look at it from the perspective that the government first spends its currency into the economy then taxes some of it back we can say that taxes allow the government to obtain necessary resources without straining the capacity of the economy or outbiddingxa0other market participantsxa0and driving up prices excessively In other wordsxa0one effect of taxes is to lower the spending of the private sector to offset the government’s spending – ie maintaining price stabilityxa0with full employment As we’ll see it is very important that the government gets the right balance especially when it comes to causing unemployment It clearly makes no sense for the government to leave somexa0of the populationxa0without thexa0ability to obtainxa0its currencyxa0while still demanding more of its currency back from the population in taxes Nor does it make sense forxa0the governmentxa0to drive up prices unnecessarily! TAXESxa0can help reduce inequality Excessive concentrations of wealth and powerxa0is a continual threat that democratic nations mustxa0guard against If left unchecked the country’s resources democratic processes and institutions can become controlledxa0by and for the benefit ofxa0the wealthyxa0to the detriment of the general public Taxation is one tool governments have toxa0helpxa0push back againstxa0this tendency and to maintain a more equitable society What the government taxesxa0and how much the government taxes makes a big difference in the “shape” of our economy Extreme lopsided wealth is a result of policies designed to create it and different policies could create a more balanced economy For example by lowering taxes on capital gains while raising it on wages wexa0make it easier forxa0capital to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy while also making it harder for most workers to build wealth Tax policy matters Taxes serve public purpose Taxes influence household and corporate behavior and are thereforexa0effective as incentives and disincentives that can helpxa0direct private enterprise and consumer behaviorxa0in thexa0public interest For example a nation that implements a carbon tax is not fundraising for the government coffers butxa0seeking axa0methodxa0for shifting the economy toward a more sustainable energy solution Therefore the ideal carbon tax would collect zero taxes since it would have ended carbonbased energy generation! Therefore we should always think of tax policy as its own domain separate from decisions related to government investments in public priorities Options for who to tax how to tax and how muchxa0to tax should all be analyzed carefully for their effects on the economy and implemented to best serve public priorities and goals But taxes should never be assessed based uponxa0the false notion that taxes “raise funds” forxa0a currencyissuing government Wont too much government spending cause inflation Wont too much government spending cause inflation INFLATION FEARSxa0ARE OFTENxa0EXAGGERATED The causes of inflation are poorly understood It is not as is often feared an automatic result of government deficit spending and is very often localized to specific areas of the economy It is best to look first at the causes of inflation before making general comments about the influence of government spending The common belief that inflation is the result of government spending is incorrect for several reasons including: Countries that import more than they export usually require continual government deficits to keep the domestic economy growing Money saved is not money spent and therefore can’t be inflationary – economies with high rates of savings such as retirement accounts from aggregate incomes may require continual deficits to maintain economic growth The government can choose what prices it pays for labor and resources so it doesn’t have to drive up market prices as it increases its role in a sector of the economy to serve a public need Some government policies might be deflationary if they are more efficient that the existing system For example a universal health system paid for by the federal government could possibly reduce costs and administrative inefficiencies compared to the current private system in the US The private
 baseless and untrue as determined by the commission Evidence presented at the royal commission shows a government determined to move as quickly as possible The bureaucracy was acutely aware of the potential for fraud as it struggled to devise a business plan in the space of a few months The commission found there was a failure until very late in the HIP on the part of the Australian Government to identify and manage the risk to installers of injury and death The commissioner concluded the scheme was a serious failures of public administration The ABC has also contacted Mr Swan and Mr Tanner for a response Ms Gillard declined to comment Morrison asked ASIO to slow down asylum seekers visas Photo: Scott Morrison was immigration minister at the time and was working on changes to policies around asylum seekers ABC News: Nick Haggarty Scott Morrison agreed his department should intervene in ASIO security checks to try to prevent asylum seekers from being granted permanent protection visas In late 2013 the thenimmigration minister was rushing through changes that would prevent any asylum seekers who arrived by boat from ever being granted permanent protection in Australia The Department of Immigration and Border Protection advised Mr Morrison that up to 700 asylum seekers must be granted permanent protection under the existing legislation The minister was clearly concerned requesting the exact number and advice on whether he could confer an alternative visa The department wrote back with a range of mitigation strategies and the minister signed up In an unorthodox move Mr Morrison agreed his secretary should write to the directorgeneral of security to request ASIO delay security checks so that people close to being granted permanent protection would miss the deadline The document states that if ASIO did not comply with Mr Morrisons request 30 extra asylum seekers would likely be granted permanent protection each week It meant refugees about to start a new permanent life in Australia would only be allowed to stay for three years He also agreed to reissue an order to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal to hear cases in a particular order to further slow down processing The initial order was sent to the two tribunals by former Labor immigration minister Brendan OConnor months earlier The advice prepared for Mr Morrison notes that ASIO is not formally bound by the request but the two tribunals are The secretary of the Immigration Department wrote to ASIO but it is unclear whether ASIO complied with Mr Morrisons request Read the correspondence from Scott Morrisons office about permanent protection visas  Razor gang considered welfare cut for under30s Photo: The expenditure review committee or razor gang was made up of Tony Abbott Joe Hockey and Mathias Cormann AAP: Alan Porritt Tony Abbotts razor gang considered banning anyone under 30 from accessing income support in a radical proposal ahead of the 2014 budget The expenditure review committee or razor gang was made up of thenprime minister Mr Abbott thentreasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann It requested thensocial services minister Kevin Andrews look at how to ban job snobs from receiving the welfare payments In a document marked protected sensitive and cabinet in confidence Mr Andrews proposed three options to permanently or temporarily halt income support for job seekers under 30 They included cutting off under30s entirely cutting off under30s in areas with employment opportunities and limiting income support to young people with a work history There was also an option to roll out an incomemanaged basics card to lessen the harshness of the measure The most extreme proposal would have saved the government nearly $9 billion over four years But Mr Andrews who is a strong factional ally of Mr Abbott also anticipated a backlash The documents reveal he may have been responsible for killing off the plan In a draft letter to Mr Abbott and copied to thenemployment minister Eric Abetz and thenhuman services minister Marise Payne he expressed significant concerns about the razor gangs request This is a fundamental change to Australias universal social security system … it is not clear that there is a strong evidence base for this approach he wrote in the attached proposal Young people in financial hardship could experience homelessness be driven to crime and other antisocial behaviour family breakdown and possible criminal flowon resulting from removing the social security safety net He noted that there was already a crackdown on youth welfare factored into the 2014 budget and suggested any further changes be part of a broader review of welfare

crosscheck ourxa0 biometrics xa0 license plates xa0and DNA against a growing database of unsolved crimes and potential criminals we are no longer “innocent until proven guilty” Military Empire: America’s endless global wars and burgeoning military empire—funded by taxpayer dollars—have depleted our resources overextended our military and increased our similarities to the Roman Empire and its eventual demise Black budget spending has completely undermined any hope of fiscal transparency with government contractors padding their pockets at the expense of taxpayers and the nation’s infrastructure—railroads water pipelines ports dams bridges airports and roads—taking the hit The US now operates approximately 800 military bases in foreign countries around the globe at an annual cost of at least $156 billion The consequences of financing a global military presence are dire In fact David Walker former comptroller general of the US believes there are “striking similarities” between America’s current situation and the factors that contributed to the fall of Rome  including “declining moral values and political civility at home an overconfident and overextended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government” I haven’t even touched on the corporate state the military industrial complex SWAT team raids invasive surveillance technology zero tolerance policies in the schools overcriminalization or privatized prisons to name just a few but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms So how do we go about reclaiming our freedoms and reining in our runaway government Essentially there are four camps of thought among the citizenry when it comes to holding the government accountable Which camp you fall into says a lot about your view of government—or at least your view of whichever administration happens to be in power at the time In the first camp are those who trust the government to do the right thing despite the government’s repeated failures in this department In the second camp are those who not only don’t trust the government but think the government is out to get them In the third camp are those who see government neither as an angel nor a devil but merely as an entity that needs to be controlled or as Thomas Jefferson phrased it bound “down from mischief with the chains of the Constitution” Then there’s the fourth camp comprised of individuals who pay little to no attention to the workings of government Easily entertained easily distracted easily led these are the ones who make the government’s job far easier than it should be It is easy to be diverted distracted and amused by the antics of politicians the pomp and circumstance of awards shows athletic events and entertainment news and the feelgood evangelism that passes for religion today What is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America where unemployment poverty inequality injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms The powersthatbe want us to remain divided alienated from each other based on our politics our bank accounts our religion our race and our value systems Yet as George Orwell observed “The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians” The only distinction that matters anymore is where you stand in the American police state In other words you’re either part of the problem or part of the solution America is at a crossroads History may show that from this point forward we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a militaristic state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom Certainly as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People xa0we have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age: the age of authoritarianism Even with its constantly shifting terrain this topsyturvy travesty of law and government has become America’s new normal As long as we continue to put our politics ahead of our principles—moral legal and constitutional—“we the people” will lose And you know who will keep winning by playing on our prejudices capitalizing on our fears deepening our distrust of our fellow citizens and dividing us into polarized warring camps incapable of finding consensus on the one true menace that is an immediate threat to all of our freedoms The government When we lose sight of the true purpose of government—to protect our rights—and fail to keep the government in its place as our servant we allow the government to overstep its bounds and become a tyrant that rules by brute force Rule by brute force That’s about as good a description as you’ll find for the sorry state of our republic The list of abuses being perpetrated against the American people by their government is growing rapidly: SWAT teams crashing through doors Militarized police shooting unarmed citizens Traffic cops tasering old men and pregnant women for not complying fast enough with an order Resource officers shackling children for acting like children Citizens being jailed for growing vegetable gardens in their front yards and holding prayer services in their backyards Drivers having their cash seized under the pretext that they might have

 For every new dollar of bank credit the private sector debt burden grewxa0– perhaps your house mortgage or your company’s new equipment financing However when the governmentxa0spends itsxa0currency into the economy no household or business became further indebted Instead the recipient received an increased bank balance free of any offsetting obligation to repay This is a vital distinction to grasp: when the government pays for some public service or infrastructure the private sector doesn’t have to go higher into debt to pay for it And remember that the government doesn’t have to tax more every time it initiates new investments but rather only if the economy requires some tax adjustment to manage inflation or other public concerns The banking system is integral to how our modern monetary system works and there is much to say about how it can be improved to better serve the public That topicxa0is beyond the scope of this current project but you can look up the works of MMT economists such asxa0Bill Mitchell Stephanie Kelton Warren Mosler Randall Wray and Eric Tymoignexa0on the topic if you are interested Are central banks part of the government Are central banks part of the government CENTRAL BANKS ARE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN GRANTED SOME LIMITED AUTONOMY SUCH ASxa0MANAGING INTEREST RATES Governments thatxa0issue a national currencyxa0typically do so viaxa0the combination of axa0Treasury and a Central Bank although somexa0countries combine them into one government institution with different departments responsible for each function These institutionsxa0coordinate with each otherxa0to credit bank accounts when making paymentsxa0on behalf of the government and debiting bank accounts when collecting taxes Treasury departments and the Central Bank must always coordinate their activities daily to make sure all government payments are cleared all government bonds are sold at issuance or repaid at maturity and the target interest rate is maintained Given how they are subject to Congressional oversight and legislative power Central Banks are notxa0as independent as most suppose Nearly all central banks around the world are owned and ultimately controlled by their governments WHILE IMPORTANT THE ROLE OF CENTRAL BANKS IN THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED There is a common perception that the health of the economy is in the hands of the Central Bank Also given the common lack of transparency into their operationsxa0theyxa0are often viewed with much suspicionxa0A better understanding of modern monetary systemsxa0can help the public bring about a more transparent accountable and useful role for our national banks Firstly while they have important roles to playxa0central banksxa0are not thexa0allpowerful agents that many assume Fiscal policy – the way the government invests and taxes – plays a much more important role in maintaining a healthy economy than the activities of the Central Bank During recessions thexa0amount of money the government removes from the economy in taxes is automatically reduced andxa0the amount it adds via payments for unemployment and other welfare programs automatically rises without any Congressional action needed Such a rise in what we call government deficits during recessions is both normal and helpful and is more powerful in promoting an economicxa0recovery than anything the Central Bank can do Fiscal policy could be made even more effective by policies such as a job guarantee to directly address the problem of involuntary unemployment Central Banks can only try to influence the economy by adjusting interest rates hoping the changesxa0transfer through business and household behavior to cause more job creation The effectiveness of this approach is at best slow if not inadequate HOW CAN CENTRAL BANKS BEST SERVE THE PUBLIC Thexa0essential responsibilities of the Central Bank are usually as follows: Maintaining an effective payments system between banks Providing oversight of banks and stepping in to keep the financial system from being affected by banks that get into trouble Managing one or more target interest rates thatxa0it believesxa0willxa0affect levels of bankxa0credit in the economy Conducting research and publishing data on the economy Understanding modern money provides a fresh perspective with which to reform our financial systemxa0including the role of the Central Bank A few key ideas include: Establishing a permanent zero interest rate policy Fiscal policy should be the primary tool for maintaining full employment and a stable economy Interest rate adjustments are an ineffectivexa0and unnecessary policy tool Cease the issuance of Treasury bonds There is no public purpose served by maintaining the pretense of the government borrowing its own currency Insure all deposits without limit There is no reason to leave depositors exposed to bank failures and this also replaces the need for Treasury bonds as safe financial assets Implement a Postal Banking or similar institution This will ensure that all citizens especially the disadvantaged have access to community banking affordable bank creditxa0and other important services Narrow the rolexa0of chartered private banks toxa0a basic set of services which include maintaining deposit accounts facilitating paymentsxa0and underwriting good credit More speculative or risky financial innovations should be provided by private institutions without the backing of the Central Bank or Treasury Maintain strict oversight of the quality of bank assets ie make sure they are making good loans The financial system should be carefully watched for signs of excessive risk taking and bad underwriting practices or fraud that can lead to another financial crisis Much has been written on these subjects by MMT economists and scholars and we encourage citizens to become informedxa0and advocate for reforms All this said while it is easy to find fault with our financial system it is also important to understand what the real problems are and focus on the right solutionsxa0Our monetary system is very powerful and it can be made to serve the publicxa0even better with the right changes What is money What is money Defining the word “money” can be a bit tricky in English because we use the same word in more than one way This is why we have often avoided the word money and instead talk about how the government makes payments or banks issue bank credit However since this question arises so often here are a few important ideas to grasp Money has its origins in a societal context not from barter Money is firstxa0a unit of account –xa0the unit to measurexa0debts or tax liabilitiesxa0like a meter measures distance Eachxa0unit ofxa0account has its origins from a societal authority —xa0in modern times this is the state The state also issues money “things” denominated in its unit of account such as paper notes or recorded Central Bank account balances Banks are granted a license to create deposits denominated in the state’s unit of account and other institutions and entities also adopt the state’s unit for financial purposes creating a sort of “hierarchy of money” How Did Money Arise As far back as historians have been able to study in civilizations all around the globe money appears to have originated from some form of local authority – a tribe a temple culture a citystate a nation The earliest money units were often grain weights such as a mina or shekel and later pound and were a form of record keeping by authorities Historians now believe that we invented writing to keep track of debts in communities For thousands of years there appear records of societal obligations: a tax a fine a tithe a tribute a debt Historians and numismatists find no evidence that money arose in a barter coin commodity or marketexchange context despite the repeated use of this story in Economics 101 textbooks! Rather historians provide us with a far more interesting account of the role of money as a social and legal institution tied to the formation of civilizations the maintenance of order among communities the provisioning of resources for governance community securityxa0and development and the recording and clearing of debts around seasonal harvestsxa0We may never know the very first use of money but we can learn a lot from what we do know The State Unit Of Account Is The Foundation of Modern Money It is important to understand that the norm is for thexa0constituted governmentxa0to choose a monetary unit of account for the nation eg Yen Pound Lira Dollar to issue a currency denominated in that unit which it uses to make payments and to impose taxes or other obligations as a mechanism for redeemingxa0such governmentissued IOUs One nation: one currency is the rule  The currency exists first as a mechanism to provision the common needs of the nation  Upon this foundation there can be a “money hierarchy” of additional institutional and personal IOUs denominated in the state’s unit of account with varying degrees of acceptability from bank credit to a local bar tab We use the term currency in this guide to refer to all the “money things” that the government issues and accepts as payment of the taxes and other liabilities it imposes Today almost all currency is in the form of recorded Central Bank account balances with corresponding credit to the bank balance of a person or entity although most governments still issue some notes and coins We find that money is best thought of as a social and legal institution that societies create to serve the needs of their communities

a simple road…xa0Tonight I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $15 trillion for the new infrastructure that our country desperately needs” “Together we can reclaim our building heritage We will build gleaming new roads bridges highways railways and waterways all across our land And we will do it with American heart American hands and American grit” he continued “We

he says his administration has “eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history” 9:33 PM: TRUMP: “Preston’s reverence for those who
 government” care about They’re not for the most part high priorities for people who care about “small government” This might explain why as a shutdown looms the burden is often perceived from the outside to be on Democrats to avoid it — not just because they’re the ones in this case refusing to vote for a bill that keeps the government open for another few weeks but doesn’t provide axa0 permanent solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA recipients  but because they’re the ones who believe most firmly that these “nonessential” government functions really are essential Government is made of people But given all this it’s important to remember: Not even the most radical smallgovernment ideologue in Congress ever prefers shutting down the government to keeping it open on their terms That’s because when a shutdown actually happens it calls attention to the fact that government is made of people — and that those people are both more interdependent on each other even the “nonessential” ones and less politicized than the functions they represent Even “essential” employees at FEMA or the US Border Patrol for example sufferxa0 setbacks in morale xa0and job function when they don’t have any support staff to help them because the field agents are “essential” but support staff is not The military may itself be deemed essential but delays in paychecks and the inability to request leave can grind down service members and their families The same is true on the other side: Americans who interact with the government for benefits Older middleclass Americans might be better off than those living in poverty under a shutdown because Social Security and Medicare are exempt not congressionally appropriated while Temporary Assistance for Needy Families may not — but if they lose their Social Security cards they won’t be able to get new ones issued And even Americans who dislike the idea of federal land ownership still go to national parks and monuments — which is why there was such a fuss over thexa0 closure of war memorials during the 2013 shutdown  and why the Trump administration is reportedlyxa0 trying to find a way to keep parks open xa0this time It’s a broad truth of American politics that people may not like “government” in the abstract but they like the particular ways government benefits them Shutdowns bring that dynamic to the fore: They force people to reckon with the fact that while concepts like “cutting the fat” and “waste fraud and abuse” are broadly appealing agreeing on what counts as fat or waste is much harder And it makes apparent that living in uncertainty day to day isn’t actually a way to go about one’s life whether one is a government employee or someone whose life is in a government employee’s hands The government that survives a shutdown is a government that is much more hobbled in some respects than others but it isn’t the government anyone wants xa0

https:nypostcom20180121governmentscramblestogetnflplayoffgamestotroopsSouth Korean Investor Brags About $24 Million Bitcoin Profit Government Now Chasing Taxes By WhatsApp On January 9 MoneyToday  one of the most widely read finance and business news publications in South Korea reported that a South Korean investor has made a $22 million profit off a $90 investment in bitcoin he likely made in 2011 For a $90 investment to turn into $22 million the initial investment needs to increase by at least 244444 times Which means for a bitcoin investment to increase from $90 to $22 million the South Korean investor had purchased the cryptocurrency when it was $01 per bitcoin The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange market only emerged in South Korea in late 2013 with the launch of Korbit and Coinplug two venture capitalfunded companies Prior to Korbit and Coinplug whoxa0received multimillion dollar investment from angel investors such as Tim Draper there was no infrastructure or platform for investing in cryptocurrencies Given that the price of bitcoin in 2013 was still above $100 the investor would have had to have invested in early 2010 or 2011 when exchanges were not available in the country At the timexa0investors used brokerages and peertopeer platforms like LocalBitcoins to purchase or sell bitcoin The investor was featured on various TV networks and mainstream media outlets as he discussed the nature of his investment in bitcoin and discussed the money he has earned But shortly after the publication of several articles about the investor the market began to question the taxation policy of South Korea and whether the $22 million return as disclosed by the investor can be taxed The South Korean government has previously announced that bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments are subject to taxes according to existing regulations and investors may be requested to pay capital gains tax along with corporate tax for their investments in bitcoin Uncertainty in the South Korean market in regards to regulatory frameworks and policies has led cryptocurrency investors to be significantly more cautious in disclosing their earnings and their involvement in the bitcoin exchange market The investor’s story has once again demonstrated the importance of privacy ensuring that gains are not disclosed in public The egotistical decision of the investor could become an expensive lesson but is an important lesson for the entire South Korean bitcoin community as it encourages the community to reconsider the consequences of not complying with tax laws As Simon Black a successful investor and the founder of Sovereign Man wrote: “They’ll find a prominent Bitcoin person someone that’s polarizing to the public – like ‘pharma bro’ Martin Shkreli It will be a very public trial… and they’ll throw his ass in the slammer Governments always do this because they want to scare people” xa0 The South Korean government could carry out a similar operation against the investor or any investor that comes out to the public and admits multimillion dollar untaxed gains on national television TAGSThis service is part of the personal tax account

Americans say the federal government does not provide enough help for older people 65% poor people 62% and the middle class 61% By contrast nearly twothirds 64% say the government provides too much help for wealthy people Opinions are more divided about the amount of help the government provides for younger people: About half 51% say the government does not do enough for younger people 29% say the government provides about the right amount of help while 13% say it provides too much The national survey by Pew Research Center conducted Jan 1015 among 1503 adults finds that views on government help for the poor the middle class and the wealthy – as well as for older people – have changed little in recent years This is the first time this series has included a question about younger people There are partisan differences in views of government support for all groups included in the survey However the gap is somewhat narrower in views of government help for older people than for other groups While 73% of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents say the federal government does not do enough for older people a smaller majority of Republicans 58% say the same The partisan gap is much wider in views of government help for younger people Nearly seveninten Democrats 69% say the federal government does not provide enough help for younger people Republicans are divided: Nearly equal shares say the government does too little 29% and too much 27% for younger people while 36% say it provides about the right amount of help In addition there are sizable age differences in views of government help for younger people – but not in how much the government does for older people A majority of those younger than 50 58% say the government does not do enough for younger people compared with 44% of those 50 and older Nearly identical shares of those under 50 65% and those 50 and older 66% say the federal government does not do enough for older people Views of government help for poor wealthy middle class The partisan divide in views of government aid for the poor is wider than for other groups Fully 82% of Democrats say the federal government does not provide enough help for poor people compared with just 36% of Republicans About as many Republicans say the government does too much for the poor 33% as say it does too little 27% say the help the government provides is about right Pew Research Center’s recent report on the public’s political values found that partisan differences in attitudes about aid to the poor and needy have widened considerably over the past two decades In that study  71% of Democrats said the government should do more to help the needy even if it meant going deeper in debt compared with 24% of Republicans Democrats and Republicans also differ in their attitudes about the help the government provides to wealthy people A large majority of Democrats 77% say the federal government provides too much help to the wealthy As with views about government help to the poor Republicans are divided Nearly half of Republicans 46% say the federal government provides too much help for wealthy people 42% say it provides about the right amount while 6% say it does not provide enough help Partisan differences in opinions about the federal government’s help for the middle class are not as pronounced Seveninten Democrats say the government does not provide enough help for the middle class compared with about half of Republicans 51% Republican attitudes about government help to the poor middle class and wealthy differ significantly by family income Democratic opinions vary much less across income levels Nearly half of Republicans with incomes under $40000 47% say that the government does not provide enough assistance for poor people This is considerably higher than those who make between $40000 and $75000 or $75000 or more only about threeinten in these income brackets say that poor people do not receive enough assistance 32% and 28% respectively A similar pattern is seen on opinions about government help for the middle class A majority 59% of lowerincome Republicans say the middle class does not receive enough help That compares with about half of Republicans with higher family incomes And while 58% of Republicans with incomes of less than $40000 say the government provides too much help to wealthy people only about fourinten 41% of those with incomes of $40000 or more say the same Large majorities of Democrats across income categories say the federal government does not provide enough help for the poor and middle class and that it provides too much help for the wealthy PaginationBy Raymond Wong 20180131 15:19:23 UTC Apple has confirmed the US government is investigating the company after it was discovered Apple slowed down aka throttled older iPhones  The US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are reportedly probing the company though Apple wouldnt confirm any specific agencies The tech giant however has denied any malicious intent and reiterated that we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades SEE ALSO: Why it makes sense for Apple to drop 3D Touch from this years new iPhone As its being investigated by the US government Mashables received the following statement from Apple: About a year ago we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on certain iPhones with older batteries We know that iPhones have become an important part of the daily lives of our customers and our intention was to improve the customer experience We sought to further improve the customer experience in December by announcing a significant discount on replacement batteries for certain iPhones We also announced that we began developing a new iOS feature to show battery health and which would recommend when the user should consider replacing their battery These actions were taken to further assist our customers and help extend the life of their iPhones In addition users will be able to see if the power management feature is being used to prevent unexpected shutdowns and turn if off if they so choose These features will be included in a developer release next month and a user release this Spring As we told our customers in December we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love Making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them Following the throttling discovery Apple apologized to customers for failing to be more transparent about what was actually happening behind the scenes The company has since created several initiatives to correct its mistakes The first was to slash battery replacements for outofwarranty devices from $79 to $29  The second move is forthcoming in a future update iOS 113  set to be released sometime in the spring iOS 113 will include two important new features: 1 more detailed information on an iPhone batterys health and 2 a setting thatll let users turn off any automatic power management features As weve said before the software update is a good olive branch to please upset customers but it may not be such a great idea Capita crashes but it will survive more’s the pity Two of its most highprofile contracts are collecting the BBC licence fee from households and running the London Congestion Charge It also looks after thexa0NHS’s administration services Work by the research groupxa0 Tussell xa0suggests that the firm won contracts from 226 different public sector buyers over the last two years alone with around half of these coming from local governments Capita secured more than twice as many contracts as its next biggest rivalxa0Mitiexa0over that period emphasising the degree to which the public sector depends on the firm So it only does public sector work No The 2016xa0 annual report xa0said 53 per cent of Capita’s revenue came from the private sector This includes work for pension funds retailers and telecoms companies The company employs around 73000 people three quarters of them in the UK and the rest in Europe India and South Africa In the six months to June 2017 Capita reported total revenues of £21bn roughly the same as the year earlier However reported profits were only £28m down 26 per cent on a year earlier Free cash flow fell 9 per cent to £182m Weakening results and profit warnings had forced the departure of previous chief executive of three years Andy Parker in March last year The Capita share price peaked at £13 in July 2015 On Wednesday it was trading at just £182 That has taken the market capitalisation of the firm from above £86bn to just £12bn What’s the latest thing that’s gone wrong In its announcement to the stock market on Tuesday the new chief executive Jonathan Lewis did not hold back He said Capita was spread over too many markets had underinvested and that there had been “too much emphasis on acquisitions to drive growth” He also mentioned “weakness in new sales” “Capita is too complex it is driven by a shortterm focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility” was Mr Lewis’s unsparing conclusion On top of thisxa0Mr Lewis saidxa0the firm still had too much debt at £115bn and that this urgentlyxa0needed to be brought downxa0through selling assets “Not exactly solid foundations” responded Mike vanxa0Dulken head of Research atxa0Accendoxa0Markets Other analysts and traders were similarly spooked especially with the Carillionxa0experience fresh in their mindxa0xa0hence the brutalxa0share price sell off So is Capita the newxa0Carillion Some City of London analysts welcomed the drastic action by Mr Lewis to shore up Capita’s balance sheet suggesting this is this kind of “kitchen sinking” thatxa0Carillionxa0ought to have donexa0 Some highlighted that Capita’s cash reserves are around £12bn which shouldxa0in theoryxa0give it leeway to get its house in order Carillionxa0ultimately failed because its banks refused to extend their loans to the firm Yet though Capita’s cash position is stronger than the £390mxa0thatxa0Carillionxa0was reporting in its most recent reportxa0it was not lost on investors thatxa0Carillionxa0burnedxa0through that cash extraordinarily rapidly so that it had just £29mxa0in the bank by the time it finally sank into liquidation The deficit in Capita’s defined benefit pension scheme is also apparently smaller thanxa0Carillion’s Mr Lewis told the stock market that the deficit was expected to be “significantly below” the £381mxa0reported last June versusxa0Carillion’s roughlyxa0£600m shortfall and that the firm would pump an additionalxa0£21mxa0into the scheme this year The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the Government was monitoring the health of Capita and did not think it was in “a comparable position” to Carillion But the reference by Mr Lewis to acquisitions being used to drive growth at Capita and the slowdown in contract renewals is ominous because that appears to be the story ofxa0Carillion’s downfall Michael Donnelly of the stockbroker Panmure Gordon who has been warning about the fragility of Capita for two yearsxa0estimates that £469m of its public sectorxa0contracts are up for retender this year If it cannot hold on to those contractsxa0and the revenues from themxa0it will be in serious trouble Could other outsourcing companies be in trouble too Some of the big players in the outsourcing sector are certainly under similar pressure in the stock markets The share price ofxa0Sercoxa0is down 30xa0per cent over the past three yearsxa0Mitiexa0is down 36xa0per cent over that timexa0Interservexa0is down 81xa0per cent Both fell further on Wednesday Analysts say thesexa0firms have been underbidding for public sector contracts in recent years effectively overstretching themselves financially to win new work However other outsourcersxa0are doing better in the stock marketxa0G4S’s share pricexa0is flat late 2014xa0Sodexoxa0is 27 per cent higher andxa0ISSxa0up 33xa0per cent The broad point about outsourcing firms like Capita is that it is inherently difficultxa0for outsiders to estimate their value accurately since their worth is largely based on complex and opaque contracts for the future delivery of services If managements are overly aggressive in their valuations of these contracts and the amount of profit they expect to make from themxa0it’s not simple for outsiders to identify that hubris The National Audit Office argued xa0in 2013 that there ought to be more public transparency over the sector’s books given the public sector’s inordinate reliance on them In response to thexa0Carillionxa0debacle and the latest crisis for Capita Labour isxa0 pressing xa0for the law to be changed to

News can reveal The assessment which is titled “EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing” and dated January 2018 looked at three of the most plausible Brexit scenarios based on existing EU arrangements Under a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU UK growth would be 5% lower over the next 15 years compared to current forecasts according to the analysis The no deal scenario which would see the UK revert to World Trade Organization WTO rules would reduce growth by 8% over that period The softest Brexit option of continued singlemarket access through membership of the European Economic Area would in the longer term still lower growth by 2% These calculations do not take into account any shortterm hits to the economy from Brexit such as the cost of adjusting the economy to new customs arrangements Pin The cover title of the new analysis The assessment seen by BuzzFeed News is being kept tightly guarded inside government It was prepared by officials across Whitehall for the Department for Exiting the European Union DExEU and is reportedly being presented to key ministers in onetoone meetings this week ahead of discussion at the Brexit cabinet subcommittee next week Asked why the prime minister was not making the analysis public a DExEU source told BuzzFeed News: Because its embarrassing Even though the analysis assumes that the UK will agree a trade deal with the US roll over dozens of the EU’s current trade agreements and consider loosening regulations after Brexit there is no scenario that does not leave the country worse off Officials believe the methodology for the new assessment is better than that used for similar analyses before the referendum The January 2018 analysis looked only at existing EU arrangements which means bespoke arrangements have yet to be modelled Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she is seeking a deep and special partnership with the EU The other main findings of the analysis: • Almost every sector of the economy included in the analysis would be negatively impacted in all three scenarios with chemicals clothing manufacturing food and drink and cars and retail the hardest hit The analysis found that only the agriculture sector under the WTO scenario would not be adversely affected • Every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios with the North East the West Midlands and Northern Ireland before even considering the possibility of a hard border facing the biggest falls in economic performance • There is a risk that London’s status as a financial centre could be severely eroded with the possibilities available under an FTA not much different to those in the WTO option • On the plus side the analysis assumes in all scenarios that a trade deal with the US will be concluded and that it would benefit GDP by about 02% in the long term Trade deals with other nonEU countries and blocs such as China India Australia the Gulf countries and the nations of Southeast Asia would add in total a further 01% to 04% to GDP over the long term Pin Britains Secretary of State for Exiting the EU David Davis Theresa May European Commission President JeanClaude Juncker and EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in December 2017 in Brussels The government has found itself in repeated difficulty over the existence – or lack – of Brexit impact studies Last year the Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that dozens had been carried out “in excruciating detail” but after a Commons vote forced the publication of these assessments he told MPs he had been misunderstood and they did not exist after all DExEU published a series of broad sectoral analyses instead The biggest negative impact comes from the UK’s decision to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market – the issue at the heart of the Conservative Party’s ongoing internal strife over Brexit Leaving these arrangements creates what the analysis calls “nontariff barriers” to trade such as loss of market access in certain sectors and new customs and border checks and practices Some of these can be minimised if Britain were to remain in the single market via the EEA and the impact can also be partly offset through domestic policy or trade deals with the US and others but the losses cannot be eliminated altogether once the UK is outside the customs union This new analysis suggests that there could be opportunity for the UK in agreeing trade deals with nonEU countries and deregulating in areas such as the environment product standards and employment law However the analysis also casts doubt on the idea that these benefits would be enough to mitigate the losses to the economy caused by leaving the single market and customs union Moving away from the existing set of rules and standards would also make it harder to trade with the EU in the future and would be politically controversial domestically This specific debate risks deepening the conflict inside the Tory party between those such as chancellor Philip Hammond who want to remain more closely aligned to the EU for years and the hardline Brexiteers led by backbencher Jacob ReesMogg A government spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: “We have already set out that the government is undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis in support of our EU exit negotiations and preparations We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work and that ministers have a duty not to publish anything that could risk exposing our negotiation position” A government source said: “As part of its preparations for leaving the European Union officials from across Whitehall are undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis An early draft of this next stage of analysis has looked at different offtheshelf arrangements that currently exist as well as other external estimates It does not however set out or measure the details of our desired outcome – a new deep and special partnership with the EU – or predict the conclusions of the negotiations It also contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependent on a wide range of assumptions which demonstrate that significantly more work needs to be carried out to make use of this analysis and draw out conclusions” Alberto Nardelli is Europe editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in London Contact Alberto Nardelli at albertonardelli@buzzfeedcom Rating is available when the video has been rented This

charge scheme Photograph: Reuters More than £1bn was wiped off the stock market value of the government contractor Capita on Wednesday sparking fears of job losses and forcing Downing Street to play down the threat of a collapse echoing the demise of rival Carillion  Capita whose major contracts range from collecting the BBC licence fee to electronic tagging of prisoners saw its share price nearly halve in a day following a grim financial update that reignited concerns over the outsourcing industry and the stability of public services The prime minister’s spokesman insisted Capita was not in a similar position to Carillion  whose collapse earlier this month plunged thousands of workers and small businesses into uncertainty “Broadly we monitor the financial health of all our strategic suppliers including Capita and we are in regular discussions with them regarding their financial position” said Theresa May’s spokesman “And I would like to emphasise we do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers including Capita are in a comparable position to Carillion ” Capita’s shares plunged 475% cutting its stock market value by £11bn after new chief executive Jonathan Lewis stunned markets by admitting the company’s finances were in a dire state and announcing drastic measures to repair them Lewis appointed in October last year downgraded Capita’s profit forecasts and announced plans to raise £700m to shore up its balance sheet He also axed a dividend that had been worth more than £500m to investors over the past three years A costcutting programme is expected to result in job losses among Capita’s 67000 employees 50000 of whom are in the UK while parts of the business will be sold to raise cash Within 10 hours of its statement to the City Capita’s stock market value had fallen to £12bn with a £381m pension deficit and debts predicted to hit £115bn by the end of the year Lewis said the company which has grown rapidly through a string of acquisitions had become “too complex” and admitted the firm was lacking in discipline Q&A Show Hide Capita was founded in 1984 when exlocal government officer Rod Aldridge led a management buyout of the business from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy At the time it had 33 employees The company joined the stock market in 1991 and became a member of the FTSE 100 in 2006 In the same year Aldridge resigned as executive chairman after it was revealed he had lent the Labour party £1m He denied suggestions the loan had any influence on the company winning government contracts but said he would step down to avoid any further controversy He was replaced by Paul Pindar who became one of Britain’s best paid businessmen earning £25m in 2012 He stepped down from the group in 2014 to move into private equity Capita grew largely through acquisitions but a series of profit warnings saw it lose its place in the FTSE 100 in March 2017 • Employees: 67000 About 50000 based in the UK • Revenue 2016: £49bn • Proportion of business in public sector: 47% • Dividend payout 2016: £210m • Net debt expected at end of 2017: £115bn • Pension deficit: £381m • Share price peak: £1326 July 2015 • Share price now: 196p • Market capitalisation at peak: £88bn • Market capitalisation now: £13bn Was this helpful Thank you for your feedback The measures announced by Lewis are likely to be interpreted as preemptive action to ensure a profitable future at a challenging time for the outsourcing industry signalled by Carillion’s collapse  The outsourcing model involves the government farming out public sector work to private companies Like Carillion Capita counts the UK government among its major clients with contracts that include running London’s congestion charge scheme tagging prisoners operating a jobseeker’s allowance telephone line and administering the teachers’ pension scheme It also collects the licence fee for the BBC Labour said the government should take steps to oversee the activities of Capita “The Tories’ privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis threatening jobs taxpayers’ money and leaving people without the services they need” said Jon Trickett the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office “The government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first” Frank Field chair of the work and pensions committee said it would be looking into Capita In a statement that referred to the accounting group that signed off Carillion’s figures KPMG he said: “Another day another outsourcing firm with massive debt a huge pension deficit a KPMG audit and the big four popping up at every turn in the company’s chequered history “Sadly Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners’ rights” Carillions collapse should make all councils rethink privatisation | Joanne Fry Read more Some City analysts said Capita still had plenty of time to avoid the fate of Carillion David Madden an analyst at City firm CMC Markets said the action from Capita was “a red alert” for investors but added that it “could turn itself around” “Carillion collapsed but Capita is still in the game” Madden said Frances O’Grady  the general secretary of trade union body the TUC said the profit warning from Capita was “really worrying” and urged the government to act “We can’t afford another Carillion The TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms It’s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts inhouse if they are at risk” Lewis said the measures announced on Wednesday were the “first steps in the road to recovery” predicting his turnaround would take two years Q&A What government contracts does Capita hold ShowPolitics Trumps State of the Union Takes Hard Line on Government Workers At one point in his address the president seemed to call for abolishing civil service protections for federal employees by Alan Greenblatt | January 31 2018 APPablo Martinez Monsivais President Trump treated his first formal State of the Union address partially as a victory lap touting successes in cutting taxes economic growth and addressing foreign challenges such as the terrorist group ISIS There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream he said during the nationally televised speech to Congress on Tuesday Although Trump and the White House had built up the speech in advance as a call for bipartisan unity  and the president did call for the nation to come together not only in times of tragedy  the speech was pitched primarily to the presidents base He spoke in harsh terms about immigrants while alluding derisively to NFL players who have refused to stand for the national anthem as a protest against police brutality The president paid lip service to bringing the country together tonight but continued to push the GOPs extremist vision of America New York Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo tweeted  Given both the tone and substance of the address reactions fell along predictable partisan lines That was most evident in the House chamber itself where Republicans repeatedly stood to applaud while Democrats sat not just stonefaced but often wearing sour expressions We have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country Trump said We have ended the war on American energy and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal Republican officials around the nation embraced the presidents message echoing Trumps emphasis on job creation deregulation and tax cuts President Trumps address this evening further underscores our mutual commitment to lifting up all Americans by working to expand economic opportunity North Dakota GOP Gov Doug Burgum said in a statement Trump went after federal workers seeming to call for abolition of civil service protections Tonight I call on Congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people he said Federal workers and their primary union the American Federation of Government Employees took immediate exception I was particularly disturbed that the president chose to demagogue hardworking federal employees who are already being asked to do more with less with every passing year in service to their country said Mark Warner a Democratic senator from Virginia Some took the comment as an attack aimed at law enforcement officials who have become targets for congressional Republicans in recent days and particularly at Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating the Trump campaigns possible ties to Russia Did the president just authorize purges of federal employees who dissent tweeted Nebraska state Sen Adam Morfeld Not the America I want to live in There werent many policy surprises in the speech Since taking office Trump has talked about providing $1 trillion toward infrastructure while offering few details He has now upped the ante to $15 trillion but such a sum would involve few actual federal dollars An estimated $200 billion would be taken from existing federal accounts to spur additional spending from states localities and the private sector Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and where appropriate tapping into privatesector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit Trump said Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process getting it down to no more than two years and perhaps even one State and local officials welcome the idea of cutting red tape but are wary about a proposal that would shift costs onto them Without a full financial commitment of our federal government it isnt an infrastructure plan  it is an obfuscation of the core responsibility that built our nation tweeted xa0 Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto a Democrat While outlining a path to citizenship for immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children Trump cast immigrants generally in a negative light blaming them for terrorist attacks and brutal murders For decades open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities he said They have allowed millions of lowwage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans Congressional Democrats responded with audible groans to Trumps characterization of familybased immigration programs illustrating the difficulty the parties will have in coming up with compromise legislation on the issue Other presidential proposals may be dead on arrival Trump called for support of paid family leave but that idea has stalled in Congress He talked about addressing the opioid crisis by getting much tougher on drug dealers and pushers but he has yet to outline a clear spending or policy proposal to tackle the issue which he declared a public health emergency last fall Despite the failure of the congressional attempt last year to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and reshape Medicaid Trump claimed success in eliminating penalties enforcing the individual insurance mandate as part of the recently enacted tax cut legislation We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare  the individual mandate is now gone Trump said Thank heavens The president made no mention of the national debt or federal deficits After touting the recently enacted tax cut package  he referred to workers receiving recent tax cut bonuses  Trump called for increased spending on border infrastructure and security and the military Trump touted the low level of new unemployment claims while highlighting improved employment rates among blacks and Hispanics He claimed credit for creating 24 million new jobs including 200000 in manufacturing Factcheckers questioned a number of his claims In response to Trumps remarks that wages were rising after years of stagnation PolitiFact noted that wages were rising during President Barack Obamas second term By the most common measure wages did go up for the first three quarters of Trump’s presidency but they fell in the fourth wiping out all the gains on his watch and then somexa0 according

+ ZTE  ZTE + Huawei  Huawei + Some of the advantages 5G has over 4G including less energy consumption and wider signal coverage Theres no doubt that 5G is the future of mobile networks And why shouldnt it  it will be faster and more reliable while also enabling futuristic technologies such as selfdriving cars and remotely performed surgeries Sounds great but we are still a couple of years away from the full implementation of 5G and countries and network companies alike are still figuring out the best way to adopt it In the case of the US things have become a bit more complicated Recently Trumps national security team has came up with the idea to implement a single 5G network ran by the government But why suddenly gain control over something thats been private for ages Well just in case China tries to compromise the US security The idea was initially announced on Sunday byxa0a senior administration official “We want to build a network so the Chinese can’t listen to your calls” the senior official told Reuters “We have to have a secure network that doesn’t allow bad actors to get in We also have to ensure the Chinese don’t take over the market and put every non5G network out of business” This concept is quite far from implementation being six to eight months from even considered by president Trumpxa0 Although 5G network nationalization is still a concept theres already a rough action plan According to a document from a presentation by a Security Council Official acquired by Axios there is only one viable way to approach the situation and it involves the US government building a single 5G network It would then proceed to rent it to wireless network providers This would provide the security needed as everything would be controlled by the government itself but would also be an exclusive case where private structure is being nationalizedxa0 This 5G rush is caused by the fact that “China has achieved a dominant position in the manufacture and operation of network infrastructure” and China is the dominant malicious actor in the Information Domain” according to the document Recently AT&T was forced to abandon its plan to offer subscribers Huaweis Mate 10 Pro after members of the congress stood against it with the help of federal regulators This was done due to national security concerns as reported by congressional aides There was also the Huawei and ZTE investigation in 2012 which was conducted after espionage allegations towards the two companies As far as the state of implementation of 5G in the US goes companies are working on it at full speed An AT&T spokesman said thatxa0“Thanks to multibillion dollar investments made by American companies the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road” He also mentioned AT&T aims to be the first to launch 5G in 12 areas in the US later this year Everything new is expensive as well with $275 billion estimated investment in 5G by wireless providers Worldwide 5Gs development is being worked on by companies such as Nokia  Huawei ZTE Samsung and others The lastgen network is expected to reach over 1 billion people by 2023 with half of that being in

Scottish Parliament after the Greens confirmed a deal had been reached earlier on Wednesday Scottish Green coconvener Patrick Harvie said the extra council funding more than reverses all of the £157m of local government cuts proposed by the SNP in its draft budget Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Mackay had needed to win the support of at least one other party for his budget proposals He added: Last year we stopped the cuts this year weve pushed the government even further and delivered a realterms increase in funding including a fair contribution towards the additional pressures councils are facing While other parties continue to posture from the sidelines Greens are making Scotland fairer Talks had also been held with the Lib Dems who were seeking more support for education and health along with financial backing for ferry services in Orkney and Shetland but an agreement could not be reached However additional funding for the ferries will be included in the budget regardless  which was enough to win the backing of Lib Dem MSPs Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott who represent Orkney and Shetland respectively Image caption The finance secretary said his budget means people in Scotland will benefit from the best deal for taxpayers in the whole of the UK Analysis by BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor There was a discernible pattern to events during the Budget debate at Holyrood this afternoon Indeed a mischievous Murdo Fraser suggested that the entire affair the deal with ministers and the Greens had been choreographed It was to be frank all fairly predictable But only because the Greens made their demands quite explicit  and Derek Mackay the finance secretary left room for just such a deal in his draft proposals For example there was an anomaly whereby those earning around £50k actually benefited from the draft budget because of the increase in thresholds It was an anomaly inviting action And so today it was duly removed raising an extra £55m Read more from Brian here Talks went down to the wire with Green coconvener Patrick Harvie revealing he had stayed in contact via wifi even while taking part in a finance committee session about Brexit on Wednesday morning The Greens also backed last years budget after securing a package worth a total of £220m in extra spending including £160m for local authorities Mr Mackay said his proposals for the forthcoming financial year would reverse Tory cuts deliver support for the economy and increase health spending by £400m New tax bands And he said the budget would provide stability sustainability and stimulus for the economy and services Mr Mackays draft budget which was published in December outlined plans for a new tax band of 21p for those earning more than £24000 The higher rate of tax would be increased from 40p to 41p and the top rate from 45p to 46p while a starter rate of 19p in the pound would also be introduced Mr Mackay said the income tax proposals meant about 55% of taxpayers in Scotland would pay less than they would elsewhere in the UK What have the other opposition parties had to say Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser accused the Greens of falling sweetly into line and caricatured the party as a wholly owned subsidiary of the SNP which was taking orders from head office He also claimed the budget could be summed up as: Pay more get less His Scottish Labour counterpart James Kelly said the budget falls well short of what is required Mr Kelly added: The grubby deal that has been announced today by Derek Mackay the GreenSNP deal just doesnt cut it

the company which has grown rapidly through a string of acquisitions had become “too complex” and admitted the firm was lacking in discipline Q&A Show Hide Capita was founded in 1984 when exlocal government officer Rod Aldridge led a management buyout of the business from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy At the time it had 33 employees The company joined the stock market in 1991 and became a member of the FTSE 100 in 2006 In the same year Aldridge resigned as executive chairman after it was revealed he had lent the Labour party £1m He denied suggestions the loan had any influence on the company winning government contracts but said he would step down to avoid any further controversy He was replaced by Paul Pindar who became one of Britain’s best paid businessmen earning £25m in 2012 He stepped down from the group in 2014 to move into private equity Capita grew largely through acquisitions but a series of profit warnings saw it lose its place in the FTSE 100 in March 2017 • Employees: 67000 About 50000 based in the UK • Revenue 2016: £49bn • Proportion of business in public sector: 47% • Dividend payout 2016: £210m • Net debt expected at end of 2017: £115bn • Pension deficit: £381m • Share price peak: £1326 July 2015 • Share price now: 196p • Market capitalisation at peak: £88bn • Market capitalisation now: £13bn Was this helpful Thank you for your feedback The measures announced by Lewis are likely to be interpreted as preemptive action to ensure a profitable future at a challenging time for the outsourcing industry signalled by Carillion’s collapse  The outsourcing model involves the government farming out public sector work to private companies Like Carillion Capita counts the UK government among its major clients with contracts that include running London’s congestion charge scheme tagging prisoners operating a jobseeker’s allowance telephone line and administering the teachers’ pension scheme It also collects the licence fee for the BBC Labour said the government should take steps to oversee the activities of Capita “The Tories’ privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis threatening jobs taxpayers’ money and leaving people without the services they need” said Jon Trickett the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office “The government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first” Frank Field chair of the work and pensions committee said it would be looking into Capita In a statement that referred to the accounting group that signed off Carillion’s figures KPMG he said: “Another day another outsourcing firm with massive debt a huge pension deficit a KPMG audit and the big four popping up at every turn in the company’s chequered history “Sadly Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners’ rights” Carillions collapse should make all councils rethink privatisation | Joanne Fry Read more Some City analysts said Capita still had plenty of time to avoid the fate of Carillion David Madden an analyst at City firm CMC Markets said the action from Capita was “a red alert” for investors but added that it “could turn itself around” “Carillion collapsed but Capita is still in the game” Madden said Frances O’Grady  the general secretary of trade union body the TUC said the profit warning from Capita was “really worrying” and urged the government to act “We can’t afford another Carillion The TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms It’s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts inhouse if they are at risk” Lewis said the measures announced on Wednesday were the “first steps in the road to recovery” predicting his turnaround would take two years Q&A What government contracts does Capita hold ShowIn

Mukherjee Pranab Mukherjee said a parliamentarian owes the membership of Parliament to none but the people as each of the members of Parliament and even the President of India has to seek and beg for the votes to get elected All India | Press Trust of India | Updated: January 31 2018 03:00 IST 143 Shares COMMENTS Pranab Mukherjee said a parliamentarian owes the membership of Parliament to none but the people New Delhi:xa0 Former President Pranab Mukherjee today said disruption in Parliament was a betrayal of the people and that it provided a helping hand to the government by scuttling the opposition space Speaking at the launch of former Finance Minister P Chidambarams book Speaking Truth to Power Mr Mukherjee said in this volume the senior Congress leader has done what an opposition leader should do  speak the truth on behalf of the people Unfortunately in our democracyquite a few do not agree with me as I am one of those who firmly believe that disruption in Parliament is the most betrayal to the commitment to the people of this country he said Mr Mukherjee said a parliamentarian owes the membership of Parliament to none but the people as each of the members of Parliament and even the President of India has to seek and beg for the votes to get elected The former president said that after seeking the vote thereafter finding out a theoretical proposition that disruption is an effective parliamentary intervention unfortunately I am one who does not agree with it I do feel particularly the opposition space is hit more when Parliament is disrupted And in one way or another instead of opposing the government it serves some sort of a helping hand to the government of the day he said Congratulating Mr Chidambaram for writing the book Mr Mukherjee said the former finance minister had not only thought of his own feeling and sentiment but also reflected the spirit of the people Mr Mukherjee said he and Mr Chidambaram have been colleagues in the Congress party and have spent their political careers under some common prime ministers starting with P V Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh who was present in the audience Former vice president Hamid Ansari was also present He said both of them have shared their views at party platforms with fellow Congressmen but it is not always that we agree14:27 MPs vote to renovate parliament and move out fully while it

area in the county to deal with Operation Stack And it has revealed that it is reexamining planning policy to see if there are ways of speeding up the process of building additional lorry parks Ministers have also confirmed that a new consultation will get underway in spring over where a permanent lorry park could be built Scroll down for video Operation Stack on the M20 July 2015 It follows a debate called by the Faversham and Mid Kent MP Helen Whately in the Commons yesterday during which she said there had to be a way of speeding up the planning process She said: Lorry parking is not a new problem but it is getting worse and it is time to fix it We must build more lorry parks That seems deceptively simple Lorry parks in Kent are turning people away Ashford lorry park turned away 252 people in a single night “What can we do to make sure that the shortfall in places is met I recognise that fastforwarding planning permission for lorry parks is difficult but when we get that holding area for lorries during Operation Stack can we make sure that is used for overnight lorry parking as well Helen Whately MP for Faversham and Mid Kent “I would like to see lorry parks included in all major road improvement schemes including one that is coming our way in the form of the Lower Thames crossing” Roads minister Jesse Norman said: “There is no doubt that there is a shortage of overnight parking in Kent and more widely and for services to enable drivers to take a break “The situation is far from hopeless and there are a number of initiatives underway to address the current mismatch between supply and demand “The government can play a part in facilitating provision We remain committed to providing a permanent solution to the issue of lorry parking in the county Operation Stack between Junction 9 and 10 of the M20 Picture: Gary Browne “The initial public consultation on this that Highways England expects to launch in the spring will also see views on the use of the park for businessasusual overnight parking” He said the government was looking into the issue of planning permission for lorry parks He added: We are examining how best to ensure the strategic importance of lorry parks are given due weight in planning decisions”NOTE: Shaded areas indicate US recessions Is It a Permanent or Temporary Increase In an October 2012 speech to the Economic Club of Indiana Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that ultimately what the Fed is doing is little different than what it has always done “The Fed’s basic strategy for strengthening the economy—reducing interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally—is the same as it has always been The difference is that with the shortterm interest rate nearly at zero we have shifted to tools aimed at reducing longerterm interest rates more directly” 3 For example the FOMC has made unusually large acquisitions of longerterm securities including Treasury debt But is this debt a permanent acquisition Or will its stay on the Fed’s balance sheet be temporary Andolfatto and Li address these questions: Permanent – If this accumulated Treasury debt is supposed to be permanent then it is reasonable to expect that the corresponding supply of new money would also be permanent and would remain in the economy as either cash in circulation or bank reserves Andolfatto and Li write As the interest earned on the securities is remitted to the Treasury the federal government essentially can borrow and spend this new money for free Thus under this scenario money creation becomes a permanent source of financing for government spending Temporary – On the other hand if the Fed’s recent increase in Treasury debt holdings is only temporary an unusually large acquisition in response to an unusually large recession then the public must expect that the monetary base at some point will return to a more normal level—with the Fed selling the securities or letting them mature without replacing them Under this scenario the Fed is not monetizing government debt—it is simply managing the supply of the monetary base in accordance with the goals set by its dual mandate Some means other than money creation will be needed to finance the Treasury debt returned to the public through open market sales Bernanke has repeatedly propounded the latter view for instance in his aforementioned speech Andolfatto and Li explain They also write that the credibility of Fed policy is arguably reflected in the course of inflation and inflation expectations Since 2008 inflation has averaged less than the Fed’s official longrun inflation target of 2 percent per year Moreover marketbased measures of inflation expectations remain wellanchored So it seems that to this point at least the Fed’s credibility is passing the market test Meanwhile Andolfatto and Li write that the claim that Fed policy is exerting downward pressure on interest rates especially at the short end of the yield curve has some merit The quantitative impact of Fed policy on longer rates however is debatable The reason for this is because an elevated worldwide demand for US Treasury securities is keeping yields low independently of Fed policy The possibility that forces outside the Fed have a large impact on yields is suggested by the data in Figure 1 below As the figure shows the vast majority 85 percent of marketable US Treasury debt is held outside the Fed and is close to the average ratio held over the past 20 years Conclusion So is the Fed monetizing debt—using money creation as a permanent source of financing for government spending The answer is no according to the Fed’s stated intent In a November 2010 speech St Louis Fed President James Bullard said: “The FOMC has often stated its intention to return the Fed balance sheet to normal precrisis levels over time Once that occurs the Treasury will be left with just as much debt held by the public as before the Fed took any of these actions” 4 When that happens it will be clear that the Fed has not been using money creation as a permanent source for financing government spending Endnotes Most of the remaining new money has been used to purchase

 inapplicable household budget balancing practices is one example of a badly misled public It is very common for nations to need continual government deficits — ie government payments exceed what isxa0removedxa0in tax receipts leavingxa0the differencexa0in the economyxa0— in order to offset trade balances meet demand for domestic savings and generally to maintain axa0fullyemployed private sector and a growing economy As we evaluate both public investments and tax policy we shouldxa0take care to always evaluate eachxa0on their own merits and avoid the trap of creating axa0“pay for” link between tax policy and public needs Doesnt the government have to borrow when it spends more than it taxes Doesnt the government have to borrow when it spends more than it taxes Governments can’t borrow what they can create on demand Since currencyissuing governments make all their payments simply by crediting bank accounts using computer entries they do not need to – and in fact can’t – “borrow” the currency they create on demand Unfortunately we’ve done ourselves a big disservice to use the word “debt” when we reference outstanding government bonds It’s an unfortunate vestige from our gold standard days What we call government “debt” – eg Treasury bondsxa0in the USxa0– can only be purchased with government currency eg Central Bank reserves or settlement balances Inxa0order to buy a bond the purchaserxa0must already have sufficient currency in a bankxa0account to buy the bond In other words bonds are all purchased with bank account balances that were increased as a result of prior government payments Bonds cannot be a source ofxa0Currency for the government Just as taxes cannot be paid until we first obtain the government’s currencyxa0so also bonds cannot be purchased until the government makes enough of its currency available to bond buyers Government payments for goods or services increase bank balances which can then be usedxa0to buy bonds not the other way aroundxa0We need the government to spend its currency into the economy before we can buy the government’s bonds! This fact was well known a few decades ago during World War II as the government in the US ramped up the war effort injecting large increases of currency into the economy War bonds were part of a successful marketing effort by the government in lieu of raising taxes higherxa0to get consumers to not spend allxa0their income to helpxa0prevent inflation bonds themselves don’t prevent inflation – the reduced consumer spending was the key War bonds did not “give the government dollars to spend” Think about it for a moment: if the “national debt” grew from $1 trillion to $2 trillion where did the population get the extra $1 trillion in currency to buy the bonds It must be the result of increased government payments net of taxes Hence we can say that bond sales are ex post: ie they occur after sometimes on the same day the government makes new payments Could governments just stop issuing bonds Governments do not need to issue bonds in order to make payments Whether $1000 of currency remains as a bank depositxa0ie a “reserve account balance” at the Central Bank or is saved in the form of a $1000 Treasury Bond ie a “securities account balance” at the Central Bankxa0has no bearing on whetherxa0a nation’s government can authorize another payment toxa0be made These are basically two different types of Central Bank accounts representing dollars that the government has spent into the economy The government’s ability to make payments is unaffected by whether numbers are in one account or the other Perhaps we should just direct our governments to stop issuing bonds altogether so the term “debt” is no longer associated with our base money supply This might help us leave behind the harmful fearmongering about government deficits and refocus on how to best use our public currency to serve the public So what is the National Debt So what is the National Debt THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF payments the government has made into THE ECONOMYxa0less the total amount removed via taxes forms our base money supply —xa0which normally grows with the economy Each year that the government adds more to bank accounts than it subtracts the balance remainsxa0in bank accounts somewhere in the economy We call this difference a deficit because we label it from the government’s perspective It is equally true that this same sum is a “surplus” from the perspective of the rest of the economy Balance sheets must balancexa0When the government leaves currency in the economy that means it is being saved somewhere in the economy For example if in a year thexa0Australian government invested $500Bxa0into the economy and taxed $400B there is now an additional 100 billionxa0Australian dollarsxa0being saved somewhere inxa0the world some domestic and some with trade partners investorsxa0or currency traders In other wordsxa0these accumulations of currency in the economyxa0arexa0exactly equal toxa0the collective savings of the government’s currencyxa0Every year as the government leaves more currency in the economy than it removes the base money supply increases This is quite normal for growing economies What we misleadingly call the “national debt” is just the portion of that base money supply that has been transferred into interestbearingxa0accounts at the Central Bank called bonds Do Governmentsxa0Still need to Sell Bonds Back when some nations promised to convert their currency to gold under a fixed exchange rate system bond sales were a way for governments to protect their gold reserves If you purchased a $1000 TenYear Treasury Bond $1000 of government currency could not be converted to gold for ten years Under this arrangement interest rates were determined by the marketxa0as the government had to give an incentive to savers not go after its stock of gold each time bonds matured All this changedxa0once nations stopped promisingxa0to convert their currency to gold – a promise none of them could keep anyway during times of war or crisis There is no longer any need for monetarily sovereign governments to sell bonds Countries that offer bonds of varying terms that earn interest do so by policy choice not necessity —xa0except for countries like Greece that lack full monetary sovereignty Governments that continue to offer bonds are simply giving away more public dollars or Yen etc to people who already have dollars The interest rate given is a policy choice usually determined by the central bank not by private markets SO WHAT ARE GOVERNMENT BONDS Today The government offers specialxa0savings accounts for those who save its currency In the US these government securitiesxa0– tradeable interestearning accounts – arexa0called Treasury Bonds for longer terms and Treasury Bills for shorter terms Unlike the debt of households and businesses where repayment depends on revenues the government needs no revenues to “repay” these savings accounts When they mature thexa0Central Bankxa0simply transfers the balance from the securities account back to the reserve account of the bank receiving the funds BUYING BONDSxa0IS LIKE MOVING FUNDS FROM A CHECKING ACCOUNT TO A CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT Imagine you had $10000 in a checking account and you put it into a Certificate of Deposit CD at your bank for one year When the year was over the bank transfers the funds back to your checking account That’s basically all that thexa0Central Bankxa0is doing whenxa0someone buys a governmentxa0bond andxa0holds it toxa0maturity The government is no more in debt when it sells a bond than your bank is more in debt when you transfer dollars from a checking account to a CD We should stop referring to our base money supply by the outdated and misleading term “national debt” There is no risk of insolvency or bankruptcy for monetarily sovereign governments What does it mean for the government balance the economy not a budget What does it mean for the government balance the economy not a budget GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS PROVIDE INCOME PROFITS & SAVINGSxa0TO THE PRIVATE SECTORxa0— THEYxa0SHOULD ALWAYS BExa0AT A LEVEL SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN FULL EMPLOYMENT Modern economies run on salesxa0Without enough sales the economy falters Businesses need to sell what they produce or they won’t invest in growth and may cut back on employmentxa0When the businessesxa0of a country pay workers and the workers all save some portion of their money or buy foreignmade goods thatxa0income isn’t buying the output those workers produced Unless those lost salesxa0are replaced the economy will contract as businesses reduce their production There are four main ways a domestic economy can sell more of the output it produces: Foreign trade import less export more Domestic debt consumers or businesses borrow to spend Reduce savings consumers or businesses spending from savings Government deficits reduced taxes andor increased investments As the currency issuer 4 is the only factor we can always count on to help since we can’t control other nations’ trade policies and the private sector can only take on so much debt before it becomes unable to keep up with the payments THE IMPORTANCE OF “SECTORAL BALANCES” & GOVERNMENT FISCAL POLICY When we talk

 of a national credit system is why the government is adamant that Citizen Scores are long overdue and badly needed to fix what they refer to as a trust deficit In a poorly regulated market the sale of counterfeit and substandard products is a massive problem According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD 63 per cent of all fake goods from watches to handbags to baby food originate from China The level of micro corruption is enormous Creemers says So if this particular scheme results in more effective oversight and accountability it will likely be warmly welcomed The government also argues that the system is a way to bring in those people left out of traditional credit systems such as students and lowincome households Professor Wang Shuqin from the Office of Philosophy and Social Science at Capital Normal University in China recently won the bid to help the government develop the system that she refers to as Chinas Social Faithful System Without such a mechanism doing business in China is risky she stresses as about half of the signed contracts are not kept Given the speed of the digital economy its crucial that people can quickly verify each others credit worthiness she says The behaviour of the majority is determined by their world of thoughts A person who believes in socialist core values is behaving more decently She regards the moral standards the system assesses as well as financial data as a bonus Indeed the State Councils aim is to raise the honest mentality and credit levels of the entire society in order to improve the overall competitiveness of the country Is it possible that the SCS is in fact a more desirably transparent approach to surveillance in a country that has a long history of watching its citizens As a Chinese person knowing that everything I do online is being tracked would I rather be aware of the details of what is being monitored and use this information to teach myself how to abide by the rules says Rasul Majid a Chinese blogger based in Shanghai who writes about behavioural design and gaming psychology Or would I rather live in ignorance and hopewishdream that personal privacy still exists and that our ruling bodies respect us enough not to take advantage Put simply Majid thinks the system gives him a tiny bit more control over his data Read next Toyota wants to change the world with

books and even doctors Facebook meanwhile is now capable of identifying you in pictures without seeing your face it only needs your clothes hair and body type to tag you in an image with 83 per cent accuracy In 2015 the OECD published a study revealing that in the US there are at least 249 connected devices per 100 inhabitants All kinds of companies scrutinise the big data emitted from these devices to understand our lives and desires and to predict our actions in ways that we couldnt even predict ourselves Governments around the world are already in the business of monitoring and rating In the US the National Security Agency NSA is not the only official digital eye following the movements of its citizens In 2015 the US Transportation Security Administration proposed the idea of expanding the PreCheck background checks to include socialmedia records location data and purchase history The idea was scrapped after heavy criticism but that doesnt mean its dead We already live in a world of predictive algorithms that determine if we are a threat a risk a good citizen and even if we are trustworthy Were getting closer to the Chinese system  the expansion of credit scoring into life scoring  even if we dont know we are So are we heading for a future where we will all be branded online and datamined Its certainly trending that way Barring some kind of mass citizen revolt to

transparently track each other Our central choice now is whether this surveillance is a secret oneway panopticon  or a mutual transparent kind of coveillance that involves watching the watchers he writes Our trust should start with individuals within government or whoever is controlling the system We need trustworthy mechanisms to make sure ratings and data are used responsibly and with our permission To trust the system we need to reduce the unknowns That means taking steps to reduce the opacity of the algorithms The argument against mandatory disclosures is that if you know what happens under the hood the system could become rigged or hacked But if humans are being reduced to a rating that could significantly impact their lives there must be transparency in how the scoring works China As China’s space station crashes to Earth its Mars plans are in doubt In China certain citizens such as government officials will likely be deemed above the system What will be the public reaction when their unfavourable actions dont affect their score We could see a Panama Papers 30 for reputation fraud It is still too early to know how a culture of constant monitoring plus rating will turn out What will happen when these systems charting the social moral and financial history of an entire population come into full force How much further will privacy and freedom of speech long under siege in China be eroded Who will decide which way the system goes These are questions we all need to consider and soon Today China tomorrow a place near you The real questions about the future of trust are not technological or economic they are ethical If we are not vigilant distributed trust could become networked shame Life will become an endless popularity contest with us all vying for

removal of the right to travel Rachel Botsman author of ‘Who Can You Trust’ The new system reflects a cunning paradigm shift As weve noted instead of trying to enforce stability or conformity with a

In a trendy neighbourhood in downtown Beijing the BBC news services hit the streets in October 2015 to ask people about their Sesame Credit ratings Most spoke about the upsides But then who would publicly criticise the system Ding your score might go down Alarmingly few people understood that a bad score could hurt them in the future Even more concerning was how many people had no idea that they were being rated Currently Sesame Credit does not directly penalise people for being untrustworthy  its more effective to lock people in with treats for good behaviour But Hu Tao Sesame Credits

now By Rowland Manthorpe Penalties are set to change dramatically when the government system becomes mandatory in 2020 Indeed on September 25 2016 the State Council General Office updated its policy entitled Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Persons Subject to Enforcement for TrustBreaking The overriding principle is simple: If trust is broken in one place restrictions are imposed everywhere the policy document states For instance people with low ratings will have slower internet speeds restricted access to restaurants nightclubs or golf courses and the removal of the right to travel freely abroad with I quote restrictive control on consumption within holiday areas or travel businesses Scores will influence a persons rental applications their ability to get insurance or a loan and even socialsecurity benefits Citizens with low scores will not be hired by certain employers and will be forbidden from obtaining some jobs including in the civil service journalism and legal fields where of course you must be deemed trustworthy Lowrating citizens will also be restricted when it comes to enrolling themselves or their children in highpaying private schools I am not fabricating this list of punishments Its the reality Chinese citizens will face As the government document states the social credit system will allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step According to Luciano Floridi a professor of philosophy and ethics of information at the University of Oxford and the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute there have been three critical decentering shifts that have altered our view in selfunderstanding: Copernicuss model of the Earth orbiting the Sun Darwins theory of natural selection and Freuds claim that our daily actions are controlled by the unconscious mind Startups China is overrun with unicorns Floridi believes we are now entering the fourth shift as what we do online and offline merge into an onlife He asserts that as our society increasingly becomes an infosphere a mixture of physical and virtual experiences we are acquiring an onlife personality  different from who we innately are in the real world alone We see this writ large on Facebook where people present an edited or idealised portrait of their lives Think about your Uber experiences Are you just a little bit nicer to the driver because you know you will be rated But Uber ratings are nothing compared to Peeple an app launched in March 2016 which is like a Yelp for humans It allows you

forbidden certain bad behaviours including mentioning private health conditions making profanities or being sexist however you objectively assess that But there are few rules on how people are graded or standards about transparency Chinas trust system might be voluntary as yet but its already having consequences In February 2017 the countrys Supreme Peoples Court announced that 615 million of its citizens had been banned from taking flights over the past four years for social misdeeds The ban is being pointed to as a step toward blacklisting in the SCS We have signed a memorandum… with over 44 government departments in order to limit discredited people on multiple levels says Meng Xiang head of the executive department of the Supreme Court Another 165 million blacklisted people cannot take trains Where these systems really descend into nightmarish territory is that the trust algorithms used are unfairly reductive They dont take into account context For instance one person might miss paying a bill or a fine because they were in hospital another may simply be a freeloader And therein lies the challenge facing all of us in the digital world and not just the Chinese If lifedetermining algorithms are here to stay we need to figure out how they can embrace the nuances inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in human beings and how they can reflect real life Kevin

Lee MP @DrPhillipLeeMP January 30 2018 At the weekend Lee refreshingly contributed to speculation about the Conservative leadership The Sunday Times describing him as “a friend of Mrs May” reported him as saying it was “deluded” to think that a leadership challenge was warranted: “We’d get something worse It would split the party and harm the country”xa0 On Twitter at the weekend he said he had been selectively quoted His argument was against a “coronation – King Boris or some such” he said His view is: “If it does come to a leadership challenge there will be a contest because I know of colleagues who will make sure we don’t bypass the party’s membership and the country again” It is unusual for a minister to speculate about future leadership contests but even more unusual to imply disagreement with a central tenet of Government policy – thus undermining the very Prime Minister he says he wants to support Stay tuned to Phillipxa0Lee’s Twitter feed More about: 
 schools are exempt from much of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act which means they can receive voucher funds while refusing to accommodate students with disabilities Patchy application erodes the efficacy of antidiscrimination law but that apparently doesn’t trouble DeVos During her confirmation hearing she told senators that it should be “up to the states” to require private schools to adhere to the ADA and it wasn’t clear if she’d even heard of the IDEA before entering the chamber Meanwhile the Trump administration has signaled that it would fund a voucher expansion by assigning $20 billion in federal funds to vouchers According to Chalkbeat  teacher’s unions fear that money would most likely come from Title I portability an old education reform proposal that would reallocate Title I funding from public schools That funding is currently assigned to public schools based on how many lowincome students they serve: “The damage would spread through the system raising class sizes even in nonTitle I schools threatening academic enrichment programs guidance art and music and other services our children depend on” the United Federation of Teachers asserted in a press release Vouchers reinforce a twotier educational system: Public schools are for the rabble and private schools are for the elite If DeVos funds a voucher expansion in this manner without also expanding the reach of the ADA parents of students with disabilities would be trapped in underfunded underequipped public school districts And that’s a throwback to a more discriminatory age of American history Before the ADA the IDEA and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act children with disabilities weren’t guaranteed access to quality public education Instead they were frequently confined to institutions or the home a few attended disabilityspecific schools Many were sterilized under eugenics laws But the needs of students with disabilities have never dissuaded school choice advocates in the Republican Party or the Democratic Party for that matter The calculus of school choice explicitly excludes them because it must It relies on the premise that private schools are superior because they are not controlled by the state Privatization of course permits these schools to be more selective than their public alternatives so vouchers reinforce a twotier educational system: Public schools are for the rabble and private schools are for the elite That approach harms all Americans but it’s just one of two blows that Americans with disabilities can expect from Republicancontrolled government If the GOP’s planned replacement of Obamacare looks anything like Tom Price’s “Empowering Patients Act” people with disabilities will once again be at the mercies of private insurance companies Price has supported replacing the ACA with ageadjusted tax credits Medicaid block grants and highrisk insurance pools for people with socalled “preexisting” conditions But the example of welfare reform demonstrates that states typically use block grants as an excuse to underfund aid programs and highrisk pools have historically failed to meet the needs of Americans with serious or disabling conditions According to one 2008 study  Kansas’s high risk pool left sick Kansans chronically underinsured and actually increased the number of people dependent on disability payments If Price’s plan ever becomes federal law he and his Republican colleagues will force Americans with disabilities back into their traditional role as an inferior class People with disabilities will live shorter poorer lives We already have a reallife example of what this would look like nationally: In Texas Medicaid cuts have already seriously harmed children with disabilities “We have had a number of families who have had critical medication denied We’ve had families who have had some surgical delays and have been told sorry you’re not in network” a representative of Protect TX Fragile Kids told The Dallas Morning News Trump’s education policies will only make the situation more dire Many children will be cut off from care and then cut off from accessible free education all so Republicans can say they’ve shrunk government So long to social mobility so long to lifesaving medical care so long to any illusion of equality: Republicans will accomplish what the eugenics movement sought to do so long ago And I will not be surprised when it happens On the night of Trump’s election I did not sleep First I thought of my brother who only has health insurance because of the ACA Then I stacked questions on top of hours: Should I wait four to eight years to have children Or do I gamble And I didn’t know the answer I still don’t know the answer Trump makes obvious what I and Americans like me already understood: We are in the same vulnerable position that we have always occupied This won’t change as long as we inhabit a world ruled by men who prioritize the free market over human lives Their ideal society excludes us and every other group ever deemed an obstacle to prosperity And when they come for us they will call it progress Sarah Jones is a staff writer for The New Republic 
 sector couldxa0be the main cause of an inflationary problemxa0driven byxa0a monopolistic market or an excessive expansion of bank credit eg the 2000 Dotcomxa0& 2008 Housingxa0Bubbles in the US — even as government spending could be decreasing The private sector may have capacity to expand production to meet increased demand without price increases The government andor the private sector may use a rise in price levels to innovate and solve the problem giving rise to rising costs natural gas fracking and renewable energy development in response to high oil and gas prices is a good example GOVERNMENTS CAN CERTAINLY CREATE CONDITIONS THAT DRIVE UP PRICES BUT THEY CAN ALSO & FAR TOO OFTEN CREATExa0CONDITIONS THATxa0STARVE THE ECONOMY & CREATE UNEMPLOYMENT The government plays a powerful role in determining the structure of markets and prices It isxa0the sole issuer of the currency the primary legislative agent and the regulator of the financial sectorxa0 Warren Mosler states that “inflation is a function of the prices paid by the government”xa0What the government pays for how much it pays how it sets and enforces its laws how it regulates banks and credit — all these functions serve to shape the stability of prices in the economy in a material way For example the wages that the government pays its workers andxa0the rules it setsxa0forxa0minimum wagexa0labor will have a significant effect on the price level — positively or negatively Governments can set conditions that provide a decent base living wage or conditions that allow for povertylevel work conditions Unfortunately many countries set this bar tooxa0low leading to unnecessary levels ofxa0austerity andxa0its accompanying social problems Governments can alsoxa0outbid any private sector business or even control sectors of the economy such as education public infrastructure or health care nations choose varying approaches If governments compete for scare resources or drive up wagesxa0of highdemand skills that may create inflationary conditions in some sectors of the economy So governments should be held accountable to act responsibly: to not escalate payments for resources and labor in ways that lead to inflation levels that become harmful to public purpose to maintain careful oversight of the financial sectorxa0and other industries to prevent speculative or fraudulent credit expansion and monopolistic or antitrust pricing power and to maintain full employment and acceptable base living conditions to prevent deflationary conditions and unnecessary austerity among the population The opposite of inflation is unemployment and governments have beenxa0guiltyxa0far too often of notxa0managing thexa0currencyxa0in a way thatxa0maintains domestic full employment and acceptable base living standards While inflationxa0can certainly bexa0a legitimate risk it can also be said thatxa0we too often allow the fear of inflation to be used as an excuse to avoid addressing the significant problems associated with persistent unemployment and a lack of continual maintenance and development of public infrastructure The size of a country’s government is a political choice – we can all debate what we want our government to fund and whether to have a bigger or a smaller government But for whatever size of government we collectively choose through our political process the right amount of taxation is that which leaves the economy at full employment without persistent and excessive inflation A FOCUS ON LIVING STANDARDS IS KEY Finally there is actually little evidence that moderate rates of inflation have an overallxa0negative effect on society as long as living standards and the quality of goods are improving However the ill effects of persistent unemployment and underdevelopment are real and deserve far more attention than they are currently given in how the government evaluates its approach to taxation and investment Surely the government cant just create currency without constraint Surely the government cant just create currency without constraint THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS BUT GOVERNMENTS CAN PAY FORxa0ANY REAL RESOURCES THAT ARE FOR SALE WITH THEIR CURRENCY A nation that has no oil cannot issue its currency and make oil appear The government’s currency isn’t a magic wand to fix real world constraints but it is a tool to help deploy available resources that would otherwise not be utilized ourxa0could be put to better usexa0to meet needs Each time we ask the question “can we afford to…name your preferred public policy” thexa0first stepxa0should always be to evaluate thexa0real resources needed to determine if we have the people knowledge and resources to meet the need If the resources are available or can be made available the ability to credit bank accounts simply takes a vote by Congress to authorize the investment to serve the public need Anything we don’t have domestically we have to find a willing supplier who will trade in our currency If not we may have to export enough to obtain the foreign currency we need to procure these resources WHAT WE CAN AFFORD IS ALWAYS MEASURED IN REAL RESOURCES NOT MONEY If we ask “Can we build a national high speed rail system” the answer isn’t whether we have enough money but whether we have enough engineers construction workers raw materials and knowledge of the technology to design and build such a system Do we have the political will and public support to do so Are we willing to use the necessary real estate for this purpose If the answer is yes then Congress can approve the funding Congressxa0neverxa0needs to “find money” since they control the currency Countries that lack all these resources will have to import everything but perhaps labor to buildxa0a highspeed rail systemxa0Some may have sufficient trade relationships such that they can import the trains and consultants Others may need to use their export capacity for more pressing needs in which case they cannot afford the rail system yet REAL RESOURCES ARE CONSTRAINTS CURRENCY IS NOT The availability of the real resources that can be obtained with the national currency isxa0where our limits lie Sometimes we can develop more capacity through prudent investment Sometimes we have no means and must choose between alternatives or obtain from abroad via trade Governments can’t use their currency to buy what is not for sale in their currency but wherexa0a nation has idle resources for sale or people willing to work for its currency it can always afford them We suggest that nations should always be seeking to develop their capacity to improve living standards especially for their most dependent citizens and should use their currency to full effect to do so Dont we need budget rules to keep the government accountable Dont we need budget rules to keep the government accountable WE NEED ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT BUT HOUSEHOLD BUDGET RULES ARE INAPPLICABLE AND HARMFUL WHEN APPLIED TO THE CURRENCY ISSUER We all want a government that serves the public well and behaves in a responsible manner The question is not whether we want government to be accountable with its currencyissuing power but rather what is the right way to hold it accountable DEBT CEILINGS CREATE POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP WITH THE ECONOMY Axa0“debt ceiling” rule makes no sense few countries even try this since it tries to impose a limit afterthefact on decisions the government already made with respect toxa0public investmentsxa0and tax policies The size of a government deficit is the result of factors out of its control such as a sudden market collapse and recession or an expansion in business The deficit itself is notxa0what we should focus on whenxa0designing public budgets but rather what we wantneed our government to pay for and how to do so in a way that leaves the economy in a healthy balancexa0A debt ceiling is largely used as a political ploy and serves no useful purpose in a functioning democracy BALANCED BUDGETS ARE DISASTROUS WHEN APPLIED TO NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS “Balanced budget” rules are even worse than debt ceiling rulesxa0because they seek to imposexa0strict guidelinesxa0that may apply to currency users households businessesxa0local governments but are inapplicable and harmful when applied to the public currencyxa0Such rules ignore the fact that thexa0government has a uniquexa0responsibility to meet the demand for its currency in muchxa0the same way thatxa0a water utilityxa0has a public duty toxa0serve the needs ofxa0all households and businesses not to artificially constrain supply based on arbitrary rules that could leave citizens without essential water supplyxa0Controlling the addition of currency based solely on tax receipt forecastsxa0is extremelyxa0harmful to the economy businessesxa0and the people the government is serving Trying to enforce such policies will create unnecessary austerity underinvestmentxa0and unemployment PUBLIC DEBATE AND OPEN DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES ARE EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO KEEP GOVERNMENT’S ACCOUNTABLE The public want their government to use its power for public good without corruption or waste We need open and accountable public debate on what we want our government toxa0invest inxa0and how it should taxxa0Fair elections equal representation andxa0robust transparentxa0public debatexa0is still the best wayxa0forxa0the voting population to influence and changexa0those in political leadershipxa0who are notxa0serving the public well It is critical that the public

 shows that some kind of change in strategy is needed in order for the party to be seen as a credible alternative The question is are we Die Linke or the Left in general in a position to create a forum to talk about a leftwing renewal in Germany without giving up Die Linke as the only successful leftofcenter party in Germany in decades I believe Sahra Wagenknecht wanted to test the water to see if she could send a signal to members of the SPD as the former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine had done before Her intention was to signal that discussions about the future of the German left don’t necessarily have to take place only within the parameters of Die Linke This doesn’t mean that she wants to form a new party but instead that she understands that SPD members may not want to switch over to a different party where they are unfamiliar with the internal dynamics and are unsure if they are welcome JD What are the prospects for Die Linke in the near future FD Die Linke has the chance to tap into the frustration felt by the German public in general over the chaos and uncertainty of these coalition negotiations We can win people by showing that we remain focused on the breadandbutter issues that affect people’s lives We are most successful when we have clear stances on the issues of housing social services workplace protections and pensions But we have our own internal problems There are power struggles within the party leadership Some people voice concerns about the changing core voting demographic of the party which is becoming younger more urban and more academic And while we certainly welcome young people we should be concerned about losing voters among the unemployed and among more traditionally employed trade union members We are in a period with a massive amount of disillusionment with politicsxa0in Germanyxa0In the past Die Linke has tried to convince people that if they had been voting for us their lives would change for the better Instead we need to say it’s not enough to just vote for a party Positive left politics requires people to pick up the fight in their daily life like attacks on workers’ rights and underfunding of public services What we can learn from Momentum is to go out onto the street and to be more involved in daytoday campaigns that effect people’s lives We need a change in political culture End Mark

 the whole domestic economy excluding the national government and the government sector the issuer of the currency that adds and removes dollars as itxa0invests into the economy and taxes back out The chart image below is based on data from the US economy but the same chart can be made for any country & currency These three sectors are always in balance in terms of the currency A surplus of dollars in one sector must mean a deficit of dollars in at least one other sector Countries like the US with large imports start off with a large deficit to the foreign sector’s surplus other countries saving our currency via trade All else being equal the private sectorxa0would have to constantly increase its indebtedness at least as much as the trade deficit just to stay even Thisxa0can obviously becomexa0unsustainable — it far is better that the government continues to add more or remove less of its currencyxa0to compensate for trade deficits and keep the household and businesses from excess debt It can do so forever without running out of money or becoming insolvent Our surpluses savings drive demand forxa0Governmentxa0deficits In reality the domestic economy almost always wants to net save moneyxa0they don’t want to spend all their income The currency issuer has a responsibility to ensure that it is adding enough into the economy net of taxes to meet the desire for savers If it doesn’t it is like a public water utility that fails to supply enough water to meet the demand of businesses who use it in productionxa0and households that fill swimming pools It would be irresponsible to let people go thirsty because they didn’t account for the extra water needs in the city Like a public water utility the government holds a monopoly on the issuance ofxa0the sovereign currency In this role itxa0bears significant responsibility forxa0any lost output and unemployment that results from poorly managing the net amount of currency it adds or subtracts from the economy The currency issuer should always manage its flows with an eye on the demand for money and the productive capacity of the whole economy Budget balancing is good for households but is the wrong tool for the wrong entity when it comes to the national government Why do most nations have their own currency Why do most nations have their own currency SOVEREIGN CURRENCIES ARE THE PREFERRED WAY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO OBTAIN ALL THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC Whether we choose a larger or a smaller role for our government all of the public institutions that serve the people need to obtain real resources – labor materials goods & services Rather than taking them with brute force most modern nations prefer that their government purchase the resources they need That’s a good thing! For this reason most countries give their government authority to issue a national currency When countries share a currency such as in the Eurozone there is a higher risk that the currency won’t be used by those in power to serve the needs of all countries and communities alike Just ask Greece! Nations have currencies for the same reasonxa0they have a government: to serve the public – to do things together that can’t bexa0done alone – to developxa0the nation and raise living standards for all The currency is a public tool that should serve the needs of the people How does an understanding of modern money theory help us think about good public policy How does an understanding of modern money theory help us think about good public policy The knowledge that sovereign nations issue their own currency means that they are not constrained in the same way that currencyusing governments are constrained This has a profound impact on the range of policy options available to such governments that are not available to those with less monetary sovereignty This doesn’t mean the answer to every problem is the government nor that everything we choose to do as a nation should be funded by the government The debate over public policy is important and differences of opinion will remain: however the debate should not place artificial constraints on the ability of the government to make payments if that is in the public interest Rather our focus can be on the effects of each policy on the economy on available resources and what is in the best interests of all constituents ENDING UNEMPLOYMENT An important example is unemployment: we now know that governments can afford to employ everyone who is willing to work for the government’s money and that the effects of doing so can stabilize and grow the economy while making a meaningful impact on the many social problems that arise from unemployment REDEFINING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY We need a new definition of what it means for the issuer of the currency to be “responsible” fiscally It cannot mean balancing a budget like a household Rather it must have more to do with how well the government fulfils public purpose ends involuntary unemployment and fosters the continual increase in living standards and health for all of its population HOW SHOULDxa0YOUR COUNTRYxa0USExa0ITS CURRENCY TO SERVE As we fully comprehend the power of a sovereign currency we can rethink much of our public policy debate without the constraints of a scarce money supplyxa0What would you want the currency used for Fully staff public services in every community including courts public defenders law enforcement teachers librarians … Reduce corporate or payroll taxes that don’t serve a public purpose Take bold action to address climatexa0change without harmingxa0economic growth Invest in public infrastructure especially in cities and towns that do not have sufficient population to fund it themselves Reduce the burden of health care from businesses by investing in publicly funded community health centers Develop local agriculture and artisanship to reduce dependence on imports Invest in morexa0public housing or provide vouchers for those with lower incomesxa0so they can afford a decent place to live near where they work Raise thexa0country’s basic living conditions by providing a job guarantee at a decent wage plus benefits to any who want to work Every nation has different needs and priorities It is not our place to promote one policy over another – only to urge a new approach that puts people first and utilizes this powerful tool for public purpose to its fullest Is all money created by the government What about banks Is all money created by the government What about banks SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS CREATE CURRENCY AS THEY “SPEND” BANKS CREATE BANK DEPOSITS AS THEY “LEND” Banks don’t actually “lend” money they createxa0new bank account deposits by accepting the credit risk ofxa0each customer that is willing to repay them over time Most of the money in our economy is actually created by banks – we will call this bank credit to distinguish it from the government’s currency HOW DO BANKS CREATE MONEY The government creates new currency as itxa0makes paymentsxa0by crediting bank accounts but banks also create new bank deposits each time they extend bank credit to a customer In modern economies almost all money is created via the banking system in the form of bank deposits Banks play a large role in the economy both in extending bank credit and as an agent for the flows of government currency in and out of the economy Each time a business gets a loan for new equipment or a household signs a mortgage for a house the bank uses a computer to increase the deposit balance in the customer’s account In other words banks accept our IOUs our promises to repay and issue their own IOUs bank deposits They don’t “lend” other people’s money to “borrowers” Similarly when we use a credit card to buy goods from a store the store’s bank account is credited with the amount of the purchase But credit card companies don’t “have” money to “lend” They simply accept our IOU our promise to repay the balance each month and they issue their own IOUs to the store in the form of bank deposits Each payment creates a new deposit – new money in the economy Repaying your credit cardxa0removesxa0bank depositsxa0from the banking system redeeming or extinguishing the IOU We can simplify this by saying that banks “create money” when they expand bank credit and they “delete money” when that bank credit is repaid – which may occur over many years Many of us were taught that banks collect money from savers and then lend out that money to borrowers but this isn’t actually how banking works Rather banks have a license from the government to create dollar deposits whenever they accept a creditworthy “borrower” WHY ARE BANK IOU’S SO WIDELY ACCEPTED Bank deposits have broad acceptance in part because our government insures bank deposits and supports a streamlined interbank transaction clearing system Banks have a special relationship with the government that can be viewed as a kind of publicprivate franchise of the government’s currency This perspective provides insight into how and why banking should be regulated to serve the public’s need for credit and a payments system Some countries even use a public banking system such as Postal Banking to provide these services to every local community CREDIT VERSUS CURRENCY So the governmentxa0makes paymentsxa0by creating new bank deposits and banks also create deposits each time they extend credit All money in our economy comes from either bank credit someone’s debt or is facilitated by government payments There is a big distinction worth noting at this stage
 thousands and it is difficult to draw a line between trolls and those who wrote comments somewhere once or twice and published a couple of patriotic posts Current mass protests that swept Iran have forced the Authorities to restrict the access to Internet for the citizens But many Iranians still use VPN service to access social networks and messengers This enables them to receive information share it and files they have express their thoughts And the Governmentbacked trolls who have no problems with the speed and access to Internet already await them here In addition numerous foreigners and Iranians living abroad write and share information regarding the events in Iran in social networks Our analysis report shows that the trolls of the regime can’t keep up and in most cases they cannot reply to all posts This shows the vulnerabilities of the State Trolling machine in Iran I suppose if the regime survives they will conclude and review the approach to these issues The result can be the increase of Iranian progovernment trolls’ activity particularly against their citizens and of course against the number of Arab countries and USA ___________________________

‘Comprehensively WRONG’ Jacob ReesMogg hits out at ‘leaked’ report of Brexit damage ‘Comprehensively WRONG’ Jacob ReesMogg hits out at ‘leaked’ report of Brexit damage JACOB REESMOGG has launched a stinging attack on the Government after a leaked report claimed Brexit would leave Britain “worst off” in every way PUBLISHED: 08:00 Tue Jan 30 2018 | UPDATED: 10:14 Tue Jan 30 2018 The Governments latest Brexit analysis concluded that Britain would lose out whatever deal is struck with Brussels But Brexiteer Mr ReesMogg hit back branding the analysis “highly speculative” He blasted similar modelling carried out by the Treasury ahead of the Brexit referendum  which predicted large scale job losses if there was a vote to leave  which he said had been comprehensively wrong However Theresa May is now facing demands to publish the report as she prepared to fly out on a threeday trade mission to China Opposition MPs said the public were entitled to know the true cost of leaving the EU David Lammy said: “I fought tooth and nail for months to get these studies Now the Government won’t publish them because they show that in every scenario Brexit will hit our economy across all sectors and regions Stop keeping the public in the dark Getty Jacob ReesMogg has launched a stinging attack on the Government over a leaked report Related articles Soubry HECKLED for urging Government to stop listening to Brexiteers It comes as Mrs May leaves behind a Conservative Party in turmoil amid deepening unrest among MPs over the direction of the talks with Brussels The mood in the party has not been helped by the leak of latest economic impact assessment drawn up for the Department for Exiting the EU showing growth would be lower under a range of potential scenarios Even if the UK is able to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement  as Theresa May hopes  the reports estimates growth would be down five percent over the next 15 years according to the document seen by the BuzzFeed News website That would rise to eight percent if Britain left without a deal and was forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation WTO rules Alternatively if the UK were to retain access to the single market through membership of the European Economic Area the loss would be just two percent said the report Labour MP Chris Leslie a member of the Open Britain group which campaigns against a hard Brexit said ministers must now release the findings in full Getty Theresa May is now facing demands to publish the report as she prepares to fly out to China He said: ”No one voted to make themselves or their families worse off The Government must now publish their analysis in full so that MPs and the public can see for themselves the impact that Brexit will have and judge for themselves whether it is the right thing for our country In response to the leak a Government source said officials from across Whitehall were undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis The source said: ”An early draft of this next stage of analysis has looked at different offtheshelf arrangements that currently exist as well as other external estimates It does not however set out or measure the details of our desired outcome  a new deep and special partnership with the EU  or predict the conclusions of the negotiations It also contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependant on a wide range of assumptions which demonstrate that significantly more work needs to be carried out to make use of this analysis and draw out conclusions Getty David Lammy gloated: “I fought tooth and nail for months to get these studies The disclosure comes amid anger among proBrexit Tories at the latest negotiating guidelines from Brussels which said the UK would remain subject to EU law  including any changes passed after it leaves in March 2019  during a proposed 21month post Brexit transition Amid fears among some Brexiteers that the Government is heading for a soft break retaining many of the current elements of Britains relationship with the EU Mr ReesMogg said the Prime Minister needed to spell out what sort of deal she was looking for He told BBC2s Newsnight: ”We would take for the first time since 1066 laws imposed on us by a foreign power without having a say over it ourselves That may be acceptable if we have a clear idea what the end point is” The Times quoted one source close to the ERG as saying Mrs Mays chances of survival were no better than 50:50 with pleading from Cabinet ministers said to be the main reason she was still in place Brexit negotiations continue

debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill  While the legislation cleared the Commons last month relatively unscathed  with only one Government defeat  it is likely to face a far rougher ride in the upper

@RAVerBruggen Let’s help parents more but not by telling them how to run their lives The centerright American Enterprise Institute and the centerleft Brookings Institution have a new report about paid parental leave The members of their working group disagreed about much but they were able to put forward a compromise plan In this plan new mothers and fathers would be able to take eight weeks off with 70 percent of their usual compensation paid to them by the government up to $600 per week The program would be funded by a small payroll tax on all workers The working group was aiming for a mix of centrism and hardheaded policy analysis and in that they succeeded Seventyone percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats support paid parental leave so the compromise is in line with public opinion And the report comprehensively details the various tradeoffs posed by different parentalleave plans But is parental leave something that conservatives can get behind That is a more difficult question and an important one considering that President Trump at the urging of his moderate daughter Ivanka is a supporter of the idea Hardline freemarketeers have a simple answer: Hell no conservatives shouldn’t impose a new tax for the purpose of creating a new entitlement The market can sort this out If employers find they’re more competitive without offering leave then that’s what should happen But there are also those of us who’d like conservatism to make more of an effort to address the concerns of workingclass families  the election of Donald Trump suggests we have a point at least politically speaking And for these “reformocons” — or at least from this reformocon — the AEIBrookings proposal gets one thumb up and one thumb down I like that the think tanks are looking at ways to make life easier for working parents and better for their kids I’m hardly unbiased: My wife and I both work full time and we’ve had two kids in the past three years I also like that they strongly reject the idea of simply requiring employers to provide leave at their own expense That idea while it polls well would impose unpredictable costs on businesses and give them a huge incentive to discriminate against people likely to have kids soon especially young women But some of the group’s premises are a hard pill to swallow for anyone who calls himself a conservative The hardline freemarketeers do have a point: The government is big enough If we’re going to create a new benefit it should be paid for by reforming consolidating or cutting other programs  Apparently some members of the working group agree with me here It’s not necessarily a problem to levy a new payroll tax to create a dedicated funding stream for parental leave but that should be paired with tax and spending cuts elsewhere so that neither the government nor the deficit grows Also the group seems quite confident in its ability to decide which workfamily arrangements are best for everyone They push studies claiming that parental leave is good for kids’ development in any number of ways they want to see “gender equity” in work and childcare responsibilities they tout the economic benefits of keeping women from leaving the work force to become stayathome moms Who do these people think they are raising their kids instead of contributing to economic growth These aren’t just broad arguments in support of helping working parents — they inform the structure of the policy the group proposes It pushes new parents along a specific path They will pay for the benefit through higher taxes whether they like it or not for the entirety of their working lives and when the time comes along that they’re eligible to take leave it’s “use it or lose it” A deep problem with the proposal and indeed with the very concept of paid parental leave is that it blunts the natural incentive for parents to go back to work promptly A deep problem with the proposal and indeed with the very concept of paid parental leave is that it blunts the natural incentive for parents to go back to work promptly Let’s say you’re entitled to 70 percent of your pay for staying home but if you work instead of staying home you get this 70 percent plus the remaining 30 percent for full pay — so you’re really working for a mere 30 percent of your pay minus commuting expenses and the like The point here is not that families should make one decision or the other The point is that people should have the option of going back to work early and getting paid to do so — ie that they should evaluate the tradeoff themselves rather than watch helplessly while the government slams its fist on the scale There are a few ways one could restructure the policy to make it more conservativefriendly One approach embraced by a few members of the working group is just to shrink it A benefit that topped out at $300 a week would be a great help to a minimumwage earner while just offering some starter funds to those in the middle class and higher who are more likely to have paid leave from their jobs and more able to save money ahead of time if they don’t Frankly if you’re making a middleclass income and can’t be bothered to save up for leave that is your problem As the report notes a skimpier government plan would also reduce “crowdout” the tendency for private employers to drop their plans when the government starts providing one Another option is to make the benefit contingent on having a child rather than on taking leave: You get the same amount of “leave” money no matter when you go back to work and your employer can start paying you again whenever you return This would avoid “nudging” working parents to take the time off while still enabling them to if they wish — the government would remain neutral as to whether parents should take leave and for how long but would provide funds that parents could use for that purpose if desired Still another option is my personal favorite: Fold this reform into a broader effort to boost the Child Tax Credit the kind of measure embraced by Samuel Hammond and Robert Orr of the Niskanen Center  Their proposal involves consolidating a bunch of childrelated benefits into a single refundable credit worth $2000 Just one tweak is needed: Give new parents the credit right away when the child is born Current law already allows most parents to take unpaid leave if they want parents could decide whether to take unpaid leave and use the credit to help cover their expenses or keep the money and go back to work earlier The policy wouldn’t leave out stayathome moms either keeping the government neutral as to that decision as well This policy is based in other words on the simple premise that kids are good and parents deserve support and

0 comments LIBDEMxa0peer Lord Steel warned the UK Government had “treated the Scottish Government badly” as a two day debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill got underway at Westminster yesterday The former Holyrood presiding officer who had vowed to raise complaints by the SNP in the Lords about a Brexit devolution “power grab” by the Tories made an impassioned plea for the UK to bring forward amendments to protect the devolution settlement Addressing his fellow lords he said he would concentrate on the single aspect of the bill its effect on the Scottish Parliament  READ MORE:xa0Richard Leonard urged to review Scottish Labours Brexit stance again “I believe the Scottish Government has been treated rather badly in this whole process” he said adding that there was a “serious problem” with clause 11 which undermined the principle of the devolution settlement that everything is devolved unless it is stated as explicitly reserved Earlier his party colleague former Scottish Government minister Lord Wallace said the bill was “badly bungled” “This EU withdrawal legislation has been badly bungled The Bill as it is currently drafted virtually turns the architecture of devolution and the Scotland Act on its head The upper chamber will provide essential scrutiny and shall make every effort to ensure that the principles of devolution are respected” he said Other senior Scottish Lib Dems went on the offensive too with former party leader Lord Campbell accusing Brexiteer Tory MP Jacob ReesMogg of threatening the Lords over Brexit Earlier Labour former transport secretary and prominent Remainer Lord Adonis proposed a rare motion of regret the Bill did not provide for a second referendum on the terms of the final Brexit deal “We are told that frictionless trade will arise amazingly from the setting up of thousands of trade barriers where they currently don’t exist “And on the future of Ireland where Parliament ought to tread with especial care given the tragedies of recent decades the Government says it intends continued regulatory alignment when its stated policy elsewhere is to discontinue alignment and promote regulatory dealignment “The House needs to reconcile rhetoric and reality in all these areas” he said Lord Adonis went on: “I say that the interests of the public as a whole do not lie in making Britain poorer “They do not lie in undermining the Good Friday Agreement “They do not lie in diminishing trade and our people’s right to live and work across Europe “They do not lie in scapegoating Europe and foreigners for the social challenges that we face and they emphatically do not lie in weakening our solidarity with Germany and France and the other democracies of Europe in standing up to Vladimir Putin and others who now and in the future threaten our borders our lives and our values “These are grave matters “We owe the House of Commons and the public our advice and I believe in due course we owe our fellow citizens the right to decide for themselves whether the Government’s Brexit terms should proceed” Almost 190 peers are listed to speak over the two days of second reading where the principle of the Bill will be considered No votes on the bill will go ahead this week but amendments to the bill are set to be made before it goes to the committee stage in the House of Lords next month 
0 Share The Nigerian Federal Government has said it will shut down all open drug markets this year to curb unwholesome drug distribution system The Minister of Health  Prof Isaac Adewole disclosed this in a statement issued after a ground breaking ceremony of the Coordinated Wholesale Centre CWC in Abia Adewole in the statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria by the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria PCN frowned at the chaotic drug distribution system in the country thereby endangering the lives of the populace He noted that the closure of all open drug markets would immediately kick start full implementation of the CWC component of the National Drug Distribution Guidelines NDDG The minister who identified unsatisfactory drug distribution system as one of the challenges in the use of medicine in the country however said that this has led to poor product handling Adewole added that it has also led to difficulty in product tracking for statistical purposes circulation of substandard products difficulty in audit trail and destruction of professional practice According to him the ministry issued the NDDG in 2013 in its bid to reverse the ugly trend of unsatisfactory drug distribution system  The statement also quoted the Registrar of PCN Mr Elijah Mohammed describing the CWC as one of the concepts of NDDG to cater for or accommodate open drug marketers Mohammed who identified open drug market as the hub of major drug supply and major drug problem in the country noted that the measure would assist in sanitising drug distribution system in the country  The registrar said that the federal government being sensitive to the yearnings of Nigerians provided the CWC as an alternative to those in the open drug market instead of pushing them out  According to him the CWC will provide effective regulatory activities and ensure good pharmaceutical service delivery in the country  It would have control over the efficacy of drugs coming into Nigeria and being made available for consumption for Nigerians he said  Mohammed described CWC as a purpose built infrastructure that would cater for storage condition practice environment security and also in terms of regulatory activities among others Loading 
13 comments THERE were demands yesterday for the Scotland Office to publish its contribution to the UK Government ’s secret Brexit paper The leaked report revealed there has been work carried out to assess how the different Brexit scenarios will impact Scotland Previously there had been some confusion over whether that was the case Scottish Secretary David Mundell had said the analysis carried out by civil servants into how leaving the EU would affect Scotland was spread throughout the Government’s 58 reports on the UK’s key economic sectors Mundell told Holyrood ’s Europe and External Relations Committee that while there had been reports that a Scotlandspecific paper existed this was not the case and it had never been his intention to suggest otherwise He added: “There is not a Scotlandspecific analysis – there is analysis of these sectors and how they apply within Scotland” Committee convener Joan McAlpine asked why no specific paper had been prepared Mundell replied: “Because the analysis is in relation to sectors that will be impacted on by leaving the EU Obviously many of these sectors are very prominent in Scotland and therefore Scotland’s interests in those sectors are part of the analysis But these are UKwide analyses of important sectors” Although Scotland isn’t specifically mentioned in the Buzzfeed story about the leaked report the site says it states that every UK region would be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios The northeast of England and the West Midlands plus Northern Ireland face the biggest falls in economic performance When the Scottish Government revealed its own Brexit impact analysis earlier this year Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins described the figures as scaremongering Mundell said the numbers crunched by the Scottish Government economists had not recognised that the “new deep and special economic partnership with the EU that works for Scotland and indeed the whole of the UK” would be of “greater scope than any existing agreement” The UK Government’s secret impact assessment revealed that civil servants in London had come to the same conclusion as their colleagues in Edinburgh  Anton Muscatelli the economist and principal of the University of Glasgow  said the macroeconomic impact estimates were “almost identical” Kirsty Hughes director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations tweeted: “Hard for UK govt to say scaremongering now” McAlpine said Mundell had to come clean: “The Tories were quick to attack the Scottish Government analysis as scaremongering – but now we know their own ministers are being given almost the exact same figures and have been hiding them from the public “David Mundell must now say whether he knew of the analysis If he did he is guilty of grossly misleading the Scottish public and if he did not then it shows he is out of the loop with his senior colleagues “Either way Ruth Davidson should apologise for her party’s attempts to dismiss the Scottish Government’s Brexit analysis now that we know it is corroborated by her own colleagues “We’ve always known that the Tories were willing to sacrifice jobs and living standards for their hard Brexit obsession but they can no longer hide behind ignorance” A UK Government spokesperson said: “We have already set out that the Government is undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis in support of our EU exit negotiations and preparations “We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work”

30th January 2018 xa01594 Shares The British Government’s spying legislation is unlawful the Court of Appeal has ruled The decision follows similar findings from the European Court of Justice and the High Court in London Tom Watson MP and the human rights organisation Liberty hadxa0 challenged the legality of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 DRIPAxa0after it was introduced by Theresa May when she was Home Secretary When the law expired at the end of 2016 it was replaced with The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 xa0IPA which continued to give the Government most of the same surveillance powers it had under DRIPA While a separate legal challenge to the IPA will be heard at the end of February today’s judgement has established that many of its provisions are unlawful and must be changed An Issue of Privacy Image Credit: Kevin  Unsplash DRIPA allowed the government to force Internet Service Providers to collect and retain people’s phone records and log their internet activity It also allowed a wide range of public bodies to grant themselves access to this information without proper independent oversight and in cases where there was no suspicion that a serious crime had occurred Local Councils have been caught using data retention legislation – introduced to fight terrorism – to crack down on issues such as dog fouling and littering The Court of Appeal ruling found that because DRIPA powers were used for purposes other than to fight serious crime and access requests were not subject to prior review by a court or some other independent body the legislation was in breach of human rights law Previous Rulings The High Court first ruled against the government in 2015  finding that DRIPA was incompatible with Articles 7 and 8 of the Human Rights Convention because the data collection was indiscriminate rather than targeted and it was too easy for organisations to gain access to it Article 7 says that there can be no punishment without law and 8 provides a right to respect for one’s private and family life home and correspondence The government appealed this decision and the Court of Appeal referred the case to the European Court of Justice for clarification In its ruling it agreed with the High Court in London and ordered the government to introduce greater safeguards to protect people’s privacy The matter went back to the Court of Appeal in the UK which made its ruling this morning In anticipation of today’s unfavourable ruling the government had already announced a series of proposed new safeguards – such as removing the power of senior police officers to selfauthorise requests for data – but these may not go far enough to satisfy the courts and campaigners Tom Watson the Labour MP who brought the original case against the government – along with his Conservative counterpart David Davis – has said that “the government must act urgently to put this matter right” Today’s decision by the Court of Appeal means that the government will almost certainly have to amend the Investigatory Power Act to protect our human rights

6 Comments The Employment Appeal Tribunal has dismissed the governments challenge to a ruling that transitional pension arrangements for more than 200 judges amount to unlawful age discrimination However after nearly three hours of deliberation Sir Alan Wilkie today granted the lord chancellor and Ministry of Justice permission to take their case to the Court of Appeal Wilkie said employment tribunal judge Stuart Williams failed to address an equal pay issue and may well have failed to address sufficiently claims in respect of indirect sex and race discriminationxa0Wilkie remitted these issues back to Williams However the tribunal hearing will be stayed pending the Court of Appeal outcome on the age discrimination issuexa0 The government has until 19 March to file grounds of appeal and skeleton arguments Six High Court judges including Sir Rabinder Singh who now sits in the Court of Appeal were among 210 claimants who challenged the lord chancellor and the Ministry of Justice over transitional provisions regarding pension reforms In January last year the employment tribunal ruled that the lord chancellor and the ministry had treated and continued to treat the claimants less favourably than their comparators because of their age Williams said the lord chancellor and MoJ had failed to show their treatment of the claimants to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim The employment appeal tribunal hearing was joined to a case involving 5000 firefighters over their transitional pension protections Both judgments were published this afternoon Commenting on the ruling a spokesperson for the ministry said: We recognise and value the important role of the judiciary We are considering the courts findings and whether to pursue an appeal against this judgment London firm Bindmans represented the six High Court judges Solicitor Shah Qureshi head of the firms employment team said: It is widely accepted that the judiciary needs to be more diverse and reflective of society and yet these reforms discriminate against younger judges and disproportionately impact on women and ethnic minorities Employment specialist Shubha Banerjee of Leigh Day which represents 230 judges said: Time and again we are made aware of the continuing lack of diversity in the judiciary and we read reports of low morale amongst judges and recruitment difficulties This can be no surprise given the attacks on the judiciary from the media and unlawful actions taken by the Ministry of Justice We call upon the new lord chancellor to attempt to buck these trends and to right the wrongs of his predecessors by abiding by this decision and seeking to resolve this dispute Sign up for email news alerts Sign up Browse the magazine The Gazette offers you uptotheminute national and international news opinion features indepth articles plus a jobs and appointments section Please click the link below for a digital edition

Aborigines and their entitlement to welfare Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the articles were not written in good faith and contained factual errors Section 18C makes it illegal to offend insult humiliate or intimidate someone on the basis of their ethnicity race or colour Bolt led the charge of conservative politicians and commentators campaigning to change it arguing it inhibited free speech because the threshold was too low He was the only person specifically named as having been consulted The draft cabinet submission states: All points of view were canvassed including those of ethnic community groups Indigenous leaders leaders of the Jewish community Mr Andrew Bolt himself and backbench members of the government The cabinet also considered extending discrimination protection on the basis of sexual orientation gender identity and intersex status but ultimately decided against it Last year the Federal Government tried to strengthen the test in the act  so that it would only be illegal to harass someone on the basis of their ethnicity but it failed in a latenight Senate sitting NBN Cos secret negotiation documents revealed NBN Cos secret strategy for negotiating with potential investors reveals the initial lofty ambitions for the project Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has since labelled a calamitous train wreck The 2009 strategy a budget implications document and a plan for dealing with political attacks are among the trove of cabinet documents obtained by the ABC Photo: The 2009 NBN strategy and a budget implications document are among the files the ABC has seen ABC News: Nick Haggarty The documents reveal how desperate the thenLabor government was to have Telstra buy into the project on the governments terms Telstra will initially approach the government with a number of proposals which the government will need to politely but firmly resist one document reads The strategy is … for Telstra to ultimately approach government to invest or use NBN Cos network on the governments terms The Government is still the sole owner of NBN Co which is classed as an asset for budget purposes But with cost blowouts and delays the Government is now facing the prospect of having to write it into the budget rather than persisting with privatisation The negotiating strategy shows the initial plans for NBN Co were very different The government does not need to rush into negotiations with investors making early offers another document reads The government should keep interested parties engaged through consultation rather than negotiation Read the strategy for negotiating with potential investors in NBN Co and NBN financing options and borrowing and budget impacts  Among the documents are the financing options presented to the cabinet in 2009 It costs the project at $43 billion and outlines the plan to finance it to completion in 2017 a deadline long since abandoned It canvases options to pay for the project including Aussie infrastructure bonds marketed to mum and dad investors on generous terms NBN Co declined to comment Abbott ignored advice breached confidentiality Former prime minister Tony Abbott ignored the advice of his own department and the Australian Government Solicitor AGS when he ordered confidential cabinet documents be handed to the home insulation royal commission Mr Abbott promised the controversial inquiry into Labors home insulation scheme during the 2013 election campaign Once in office his decision to break the centuryold doctrine of cabinet confidentiality and hand over Labors cabinet documents sparked the alarm of the opposition and past prime ministers of both persuasions At the time the attorneygeneral said the decision was based on the advice of the AGS But documents show both the AGS and the secretary of the prime ministers own department warned Mr Abbott against it We think it would be highly undesirable and legally confounding if the Commonwealth were to simply produce cabinetrelated documents to the royal commission on the basis of a purported waiver of public interest immunity reads the undated advice from Tom Howe QC chief counsel at the AGS We consider that producing cabinetrelated documents to any court or tribunal … would not accord with legal practice and principle We are not aware of the Commonwealth ever having taken such an approach in relation to cabinetrelated documents Read the Australian Government Solicitors advice on handing over cabinet documents  The secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Ian Watt also warned Mr Abbott against handing over the documents in an unusually blunt and frank note sent to the prime minister and his chief of staff Peta Credlin There is a longstanding and strong convention that deliberations and discussions within cabinet remain confidential and that one government does not seek access to the cabinet records of a previous government the draft advice reads This convention was reaffirmed by your government at its September 18 2013 ministry meeting After the release of The Cabinet Files Mr Abbott said his reasons for providing the documents to the royal commission were in the public interest I did because it is the job of the government not just to passively and supinely accept public service advice he said Its the job of the government to do what it believes is in the nations best interest I thought we owed it to the country we certainly owed it to the grieving parents of the four young men that were killed … to get to the bottom of it Committee was warned of home insulation critical risks Photo: Kevin Rudd gave evidence to the royal commission into the home insulation scheme ABC NewsFour Corners Editors note February 8 2018: This story has been edited in response to concerns raised by Mr Rudd The ABC did not intend to convey that Mr Rudd ignored warnings of critical safety risks at the time or that he lied to the royal commission which made no adverse findings against him The ABC unreservedly apologises to Mr Rudd for any harm or embarrassment caused A report prepared for a cabinet committee including Kevin Rudd Julia Gillard and two senior Labor ministers warned about critical risks of the home insulation scheme months before the full rollout The infamous Energy Efficient Homes Package subsidised insulation as part of an economic stimulus package rolled out in response to the global financial crisis The scheme was beset with cost overruns rorting home fires injuries and most tragically the deaths of four young installers in separate incidents from electrocution and hyperthermia After the young men died the stimulus package was discontinued in February 2010 The Abbott government established a royal commission to see whether the failures of the scheme could have been prevented and whether the government was warned of the dangers At the time the document was prepared the royal commission found that the department identified three extreme risks: getting the contracts done in time fraud and other legal risks and the political impact of failures In the end it was the deaths of the installers that brought the scheme to a halt The April 6 2009 report warns of critical risks associated with the program but does not specify them The Department of Environment has undertaken a risk assessment which reveals a large number of critical risks for the Energy Efficient Homes Package the report reads Many of these risks cannot be adequately managed in the leadup to the July 1 start date The Royal Commission found at around the time the document was prepared the departmental view was that risk of workplace health and safety issues lay with the employer and the States and Territories not the Commonwealth There had been warnings in departmental meetings of safety risks and as the scheme rolled out established companies tried to warn the government of the dangers But the key figures in the government Mr Rudd and the responsible minister Peter Garrett have always said those warnings never reached them Mr Rudd told the royal commission the rollout would have been delayed had cabinet been warned of safety risks Right through until February 2010  each of the monthly reports said that the Energy Efficiency program of the government was on track he said He said he did not know why public servants had not raised safety concerns In a written submission to the royal commission Mr Rudd stated that he had only received two implementation reports written in February 2009 and that he had no record of receipt of others subsequent to that The implementation report from April obtained by the ABC was prepared weekly by the Office of the CoordinatorGeneral for the Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee SPBC Mr Rudd his deputy Ms Gillard thentreasurer Wayne Swan and thenfinance minister Lindsay Tanner made up the SPBC or the socalled Gang of Four At the royal commission when Mr Rudd was asked specifically about the risk assessment undertaken by the Department of Environment he said: I have no familiarity with that other than that I would assume thats the normal thing a department would do Mr Rudd has reaffirmed to the ABC that any assertion he was warned about safety risks was untrue The Royal Commission into the Home Insulation Program had unprecedented access to cabinet material and made no adverse finding against Mr Rudd he said in a statement Any assertion Mr Rudd was warned about safety risks to installers or failed to act on such warnings is completely

Acknowledging the power of markets means strengthening government involvement not abandoning it advertisement In 1914 Singer Sewing Machine was the seventh largest company in the world dominating the

technology era for business More recently Amazon upended the retail sector by expanding the market for online consumption A great deal of business history can be written about companies creating dominating and upending markets But not all: Business history is about so much more than what happens within markets Today we know that industry actually transforms the conditions in which markets operate including the atmosphere the weather biodiversity and access to physical assets like clean water Scientists believe this  Investors believe it  Equity markets believe it too  as do the Pope  the Dalai Lama  and Jewish and Muslim leaders The consensus on this view extends far beyond science and the academy it includes 99% of the nations on this planet When President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Accords  citing his duty to protect the welfare of US citizens against the “unfair costs” of participating in these agreements he ignored the impact of US market activities on industry operating conditions in the United States and abroad as well as America’s contributions — as the world’s second biggest polluter after China — to this impact In the United States alone researchers estimate that weatherrelated climate changes from businessasusual market activity will worsen inequality and stunt economic growth in southern states  The President’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Accords reveals a divide between those who see markets as merely powerful engines of wealth creation and those who see markets as even more powerful engines of both wealth creation and massive wealth destruction  It is ironic that the staunchest defenders of an exit from the Paris Agreement are also those with a more limited view about the power of markets Michigan Rep Tim Walberg’s comments at a recent town hall express this sentiment directly: “If climate change is real God will take care of it … Can man change the entire universe No” In

leaders with strong convictions about the curative powers of markets stop short of admitting that these same market powers could create or address climate change Markets become a less powerful actor in this view — a secondrate power on the grandest of scales What does it mean to have strong faith in the power of markets to produce wealth and improve social welfare if doing so ignores their greater power to increase the frequency and intensity of natural events like floods and hurricanes which can obliterate decades of wealth creation in a single day The business community recognizes that humaninfluenced changes in the natural environment are already influencing market dynamics Reinsurance companies like Munich Re and Swiss Re have been tracking a rise in the frequency and intensity of economic loss events from floods droughts earthquakes hurricanes and tornadoes since 1980 Now with advanced artificial intelligence and Big Data tools they are modeling future climate scenarios and putting a price on disaster They factor in the odds of the global economy conforming to principles articulated in the Paris Agreement The real divide over climate change is about how powerful markets are If markets are powerful enough to change the physical world and its atmosphere and these changes can be slowed or reversed it follows that markets and governments need to work closely together to minimize the effects of markets on climate change After all markets alone are not fast enough or focused enough by themselves to produce the requisite changes Markets may be powerful enough to achieve appropriate levels of atmospheric carbon reductions but they need to be focused on the problem The Paris Accords embrace this view Acknowledging the power of markets means

dealing another blow to the country’s embattled government Proseparatist forces backed by the UAE known as the “security belt” fanned out across the city – the country’s de facto capital – after three days of fighting that left 38 people dead The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have backed the beleaguered government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi since intervening against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war in March 2015 But the Arab allies whose military coalition was launched to roll back rebel gains and restore Yemen’s “legitimate” government to power in Sana’a have not intervened to prop up Hadi against his separatist rivals The coalition has instead urged the separatists to exercise restraint and called on the government to weigh up the demands of its rivals While Yemen’s president resides in the Saudi capital the infighting in the antiHouthi camp has left Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher and a number of senior government figures holed up in the Aden presidential palace A highranking military source said the separatists had also taken over the bin Dagher’s office chief overnight By Wednesday morning the clashes appeared to subside The United Nations raised alarm bells Wednesday over the impact of the violent standoff on more than 40000 Yemenis recently displaced to Aden and now cut off from aid “UNHCR emergency aid distributions and humanitarian assessments planned this week for vulnerable displaced Yemenis have now been postponed and UNHCR humanitarian cargo remains at Aden port unable to be released” the UN refugee agency UNHCR said via Twitter “We are also particularly concerned for those newly displaced in Aden who have fled other areas in Yemen More than 40000 people fled to Aden and nearby governorates since December and we anticipate more displacement as people continue to flee from hostilities in the west coast” At least 38 people have been killed and 222 wounded in Aden since Sunday according to the International Committee of the Red Cross The separatists who for months have pushed for the reinstatement of South Yemen as an independent country now control most of the city Since 2015 Aden had served as a refuge for tens of thousands of Yemenis fleeing conflict in their hometowns across the country as the Saudibacked government battled Huthi rebels allied with Iran A coalition offensive along the Red Sea coast has sent new waves of displaced to the government’s de facto capital in recent weeks Save the Children on Tuesday said it was also suspending work in Aden out of fear for the safety of its staff in what the agency called the “shattered” former refuge Separatists mainly based in Aden have gained traction since April in their push for selfrule demanding the reinstatement of South Yemen under a selfproclaimed Southern Transitional Council Before the fighting broke out the STC had called on Hadi to make changes to his government accusing it of corruption and mismanagement The clashes have sparked fears of a repeat of South Yemen’s 1986 civil war a failed socialist coup which killed thousands in just six days and helped pave the way for the 1991 unification of South and North Yemen The separatists who enjoy popular support and are backed by some regular troops have rapidly gained control over all but one district in Aden since Sunday The Saudiled coalition said it would take “all necessary steps to restore security” in Aden but has not intervened on the government’s behalf The UAE – a pillar of the coalition – has close ties to separatist leader Hani bin Breik while its “security belt” force backs the STC A Yemeni government source said the coalition had however secured guarantees the separatists would not storm the presidential palace in Aden More than 9200 Yemenis have been killed since the coalition intervened in the war three years ago triggering what the UN has called the world’s largest humanitarian disaster The coalition’s original mission of rolling back Houthi gains has expanded to include fighting jihadist groups that have flourished during the war and now keeping the peace between its allies on the ground TagsA beginners guide to how modern economies work A nations currency is a public tool that should be used to serve the people The concepts below are not limited to large countries like the US We need a fresh perspective for how powerful a sovereign currency can be to improve living standards and to develop and employ any nations resources in the service of local communities We hope this site can serve as a starting point for many around the world to begin to rethink how the economy and the currency work best together and to influence public policy in beneficial ways Read question ponder and shareas people like you learn and get involved there is no end to the positive changes that can result! Sovereign governments issue their own currency Why does this matter Sovereign governments issue their own currency Why does this matter Most national governments actually create their own currency This means they can and should behave very differently than all the businesses households and local governments that use that currency When nations constitute a government they grant that government the power to issue a sovereign currency Governments need resources and workers in order to serve the public The currency is the tool governments use to obtain such resources Today this is mostly done with computers and bank accounts – governments make all their payments simply by creating deposits in bank accounts A tool To serve the Public The reason we have a currency is the same reason we have a government – to create protect and develop a society within our national borders Countries desire toxa0develop and improve their quality of life and the currency is their primary tool to do so A monetarily sovereign government is able to pay for those things that serve the needs of society as a whole and thatxa0we desire to be provided to all not just those who can afford them The government can make investments in things like defense research healthxa0and education thatxa0serve even remote communities andxa0are not profitmaking In addition when the government invests inxa0these thingsxa0the private sector does not have to go into debt in order to fund them This allows private sector debt to be reserved for those things that are profitable or not for collective benefit while the government makes those investments that serve society as a whole Countries can use their national currency to best utilize their available resources develop domestic productive capacity and raise living standards in ways that benefit all How are national currencies created How are national currencies created A nation’s currency is typically established under a constitution or law granting the government unique powers to issue the nation’s currency The general rule throughout history has been “one nation one currency” and there’s a good reason for this as we’ll soon see We can simplify the mechanism of creating a currency down to three main steps: Government chooses a unique national monetary unit eg Japan chose the “Yen” the US chose the “Dollar” Government issues currency denominated in that unit to pay for public resources and labor Government impose taxes fines tariffs or fees that can only be paid with the government’s currency to create demand for its new money Once established the government’s currency usually becomes the de facto unit for contracts wages and commerce How do modern governments get money for public needs How do modern governments get money for public needs Governments make payments by increasing bank account deposits It may sound odd to hear it said this way at first given all the images of government’s running printing presses but it’s quite accurate Banks have special accounts with the Central Bank the Federal Reserve in the US – called reserve accounts When the government pays a federal judge buys a military vehicle or sends a payment on behalf of a hospital patient the Federal Reserve marks up the balance in the reserve account of the recipient’s bank Those bank deposits represent newly created government currency The bank then marks up the deposit balance for the recipient’s bank account for the same amount Governments make payments simply by adding numbers to bank accounts with computers There is no reason the government needs to “get” numbers before it can “add” numbers It doesn’t need any stack of gold bars or paper notes it has collected from people before it can type those numbers In the process of making any payments the government simply creates bigger bank balances that represent its currency This is of course a big responsibility and we certainly need transparent and accountable public processes to ensure our government uses its currencyissuing powers to serve the public Can the government run out of money Can the government run out of money Sovereign governments can always pay their bills A nation that issues its own currency can never go bankrupt or be unable to pay its bills as long as those bills are due in the money they create That includes promises to bond holders to pay interest promises to retirees to pay them a decent income in retirement or promises to veterans or the general public to pay for their medical care If any financial obligation is due in US dollars then the US government always has the financial means to pay it An authorization from Congress is all it takes for the Treasury and Federal Reserve to make the necessary deposits Now if a country is short of things it needs like natural gas or food it may not be able to use its own currency to pay for those necessities since they are not available for sale in that nation’s currency There are definitely real limits to consider but running out of its own currency it not one of them Do currencyissuing governments have limits to what they can buy Do currencyissuing governments have limits to what they can buy While the ability to create currency is not a constraint there may be limited availability of real resources Understanding modern money can helpxa0nations better steward and utilize their available resources and labor Governments create money every time they spend and have the capacity to do so without limit Of course that doesn’t mean that money solves all problems nor that the right answer is always to have the government pay the bill Having the ability to credit bank accounts doesn’t solve all realworld challenges and in many cases it may be better for nongovernment entities to provide the funding However if known needs can be met with resources available for sale in a nation’s currency we can remove the excuse that the solution is unaffordable and instead focus on if we want to use our available resources to meet this need and if so what approach is best In such cases public funding is always an available option The currency is a tool and it can be used to mobilize the economy to wage war just the same as it can be used to mobilize the economy to provide health services or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions It is also important to recognize that having the government pay for something that requires public funding does not necessarily have to mean that the government should manage that activity There is plenty of room to debate what we want our government doing and paying for but we should first make sure we have all the right options on the table Eg If there are no health clinics or doctors around to care for the needs of sick people the ability to pay for their medical bills won’t help them get better However if the only thing standing between adding those doctors and facilities is a source of fundsxa0we now know we have a tool designed exactly for this purpose – our public currency There is still plenty of room for public debate about the best way to utilize resources and to balance public and private interests What about Greece and other nations which get into financial trouble What about Greece and other nations which get into financial trouble Not all nations have full monetary sovereignty and this can make a big difference Simple comparisons between the fiscal state of countries like the US and Greece or Argentina are unhelpful because those countries have given up full monetary sovereignty in one or more of the following ways: Abandoned a national currency: Greece and all countries in the Eurozone gave up their own sovereign currencies and are now users of the Euro – a currency they do not control and cannot create on demand In a sense they are a bit like US states rather than sovereign nations Greece must borrow Euros or obtain them via trade The US creates US dollars any time the US Congress authorizes payments Big difference! Foreign debt: Countries like Argentina that have amassed large debts in US dollars owe their debts in a currency they do not and cannot create They can definitely get into financial difficulty since they have to earn US dollars via trade or attracting foreign investment to make their debt and interest payments Fixed exchange: Governments which promise to exchange their currency for another currency or to a commodity like gold at a fixed rate can face similar problems They must maintain large reserves of foreign currencies like the US dollar to be able to keep their conversion promise and many have been forced to default over time Some countries are able to get by for some time with these limitations especially those that have large exports but this seldom lasts forever Monetary sovereignty matters If government payments create bank deposits what about taxes If government payments create

ANALYSIS: Unveiling Iranian progovernment trolls and cyberwarriors Unlike Russian trolls Iranian trolls have a limited range of techniques File photo: Reuters By Ali Hajizade Special to Al Arabiya English Wednesday 17 January 2018 Text size A A A Lately many media outlets write about “Kremlin Troll factory” But we should remember that these methods are used not only by the Russian authorities Many different countries with regimes of varying degrees of oppressiveness use internettrolls and many other methods related to internettrolling manipulation of public opinion and spreading disinformation One of those countries which use the advantage of internettrolls is Iran It is noteworthy that the Iranian army of trolls differs from the Russian by its specificity working methods and its scope of activity In scope funding and effectiveness Iranians are far behind their Russian counterparts But they don’t stand still and we can see the increase in the activity of Iranian progovernment trolls from year to year In this regard it would be useful to consider the issue of internetfreedom in the country I guess According to Freedom House Report 2016  the number of Iranians who have access to the internet is 44 percent of the country’s population Of course this number has changed a little during the year Anyway it is a large number of people tens of millions! Such social networks as Facebook & Twitter Youtube videoservice Viber messenger and many other services and websites are blocked in Iran In spite of the fact that Facebook and Twitter are blocked in the country the country’s leaders feel free to enjoy these services using it as a tool for propaganda of their regime Other Iranians need to use VPN to access blocked websites and services It is noteworthy that using VPN in Iran does not spell out any penalty for example Russia forbids the use of VPN since 1 January 2018 however certain people in Iran were arrested due to promotion sale and training other people in the use of VPN services Telegram which has a large audience has been blocked after the protests began in Iran in the last few days of December Before that The Supreme Council on Cyberspace of Iran insisted that Telegram should provide the storage of Iranian users’ data in Iran Control for surveillance Clearly this was required to obtain total control for surveillance of Iranians in Telegram Otherwise the Council threatened to block the messenger I wish to note that it is not that simple to use Telegram in Iran I will touch upon the issue of using Telegram in Iran and associated risks in the article below Iranian trolls may be divided into several categories Many of these trolls use VPN to bypass Facebook & Twitter blocks and then extol their country’s authorities its regime and as they think protect their Motherland’s interests in these social networks Of course they also attack critics of the regime and Iran as a whole A Western reader may consider this illogical but from the point of view of Iranian “Internetpatriots” this is perfectly normal These people don’t get any financial benefits for their “activity” you can hardly find people with a good knowledge of English or any other European language among them They are focusing on a quantity not on a quality If internettrolls had a caste system these trolls would constitute the lowest caste A higher caste is governmentbacked trolls who know English at intermediate level They are more likely to receive instructions from the Government than write something by themselves Trolls who are usually young people get certain remuneration for their job Unlike Russian trolls Iranian trolls have a limited range of techniques For example in the case of Iran we cannot talk about mass creation of websites pages and communities on Facebook to distribute fake news and there is no mass production of fake content and uploading it on Youtube But this doesn’t mean that Iranians don’t use these methods at all In some cases Iranian governmentbacked trolls cooperate with Iranian government hackers For example according to the report of iSight Partners 2014 Iranian hackers created a fake website – newsonairorg in 2011 This website was used mainly as a cover for espionage More than 2000 US and Israel citizens mainly military journalists experts working in Washington proIsraeli lobbyists and people working in the field of nuclear technology were the target The website doesn’t function at the moment An Iranian surfs the internet at a cafe in central Tehran on January 24 2011 AFP Fake websites Speaking of Iranian fake websites we need to divide them into two categories: The ones that are being created for espionage and theft of information and the ones that are being created for the spread of fake news These websites function generally not in Farsi but in the languages of neighboring countries Arab Turkish Azerbaijani etc and in English For example one of such websites – tashaiocom functions in Azerbaijani language and according to its registration data is located in Ardebil Southern Azerbaijan The website shares news in Azerbaijani language but reflecting the Iranian point of view The style of writing on this website is distinct from the language used by the local press in Azerbaijan Republic Clearly this is because the editors of the website are Iranians Iranian lowlevel trolls responsible for the Azerbaijani direction often cite and refer to this site in disputes with Azerbaijani users thereby contributing to the spread of links to this site in the Azerbaijani segment of Facebook The trolls with Western education may be considered the highest caste of Iranian trolls American Universities’ alumni are fluent in English and constitute the elite of Iranian Governmentbacked trolls They are small in number but are far beyond their Russian counterparts in terms of quality Almost 80 percent of these trolls are Englishspeaking They are used for “pinpoint attacks” on particular persons foreign or Iranian dissidents and activists outside Iran Comments they post are usually voluminous distinguished by correct punctuation competent questions which attests to proficiency in English and in a subject matter Sometimes an Iranian troll from the highest caste is on the payroll in a prestigious State institution and acts as an expert in the Western mass media At the same moment media outlets which publish these trolls do not even know that their “Iranian expert” moonlights as a “progovernment troll” in his country There are also trolls among Iranian students studying abroad and secular in appearance Iranians who have been residing in the West for a long time The majority of these trolls “work for free” That is why they are not the subject of my study Creation of fake “persons” is a separate topic It is widespread in Iran These fake accounts are usually created in social networks like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Linkedin Fake accounts are mainly used for espionage and trolling Active ‘fake persons’ All sleeping and active “fake persons” in various social networks have been activated in connection with the recent events in Iran Their main objectives are attacks on critics of the regime distribution of fakes disinformation and attempts to mislead active users of social networks including experts and journalists who share information about the developments in Iran These progovernment trolls are being actively used to intimidate Iranians protesting against the regime During the discussions with Iranian activists well before the current events in Iran and before the block of Telegram they told me many interesting details about tactics and the working methods of Iranian progovernment trolls The activists also said they are apprehensive about using Telegram for coordination of activities and correspondence with like minds In 2016 in Iran there were cases when police imprisoned groups of activists who used Telegram for communication It means that Iranian Government hackers could gain access to Telegram and after that it is not safe for activists HRDs and journalists to use this service to communicate and coordinate International cybersecurity experts for example Senior Technologist at Amnesty International Claudio Guarnieri confirmed the hack of Telegram by Iranian Government hackers in 2016 Iranian activists in a conversation with me mentioned a few times that since the beginning of 2017 the Iranian Government’s need for Arabicspeaking trolls has increased dramatically I think Iran needs them to use in Iraq Bahrain Yemen and Lebanon as well as in the Syrian issue and mainly against Saudi Arabia and also to strengthen Iran’s authority among internetaudience of these countries The number of Iranian proGovernment trolls is an important issue Putting aside voluntary trolls working for free we may narrow it down Iranian activists said there may be about 45 thousand governmentaffiliated trolls In their opinion this number can include trolls from various categories including those who work in State institutions However according to the report of the researchers of Oxford University “ Troops Trolls and Troublemakers : A Global Inventory or Organized Social Media Manipulation” for 2012 the researchers estimate the number of trolls at 20000 individuals To be honest on the basis of confidential and public information that I have and comparing other figures given in this report including other countries I have reason to call that number into question if they wrote about paid trolls But if they wrote about both it may be a matter of hundreds of

Andrew McCabe stepping down as FBI deputy director Official will remain on terminal leave with the bureau until his retirement Andrew McCabe who is abruptly stepping down today as the FBIs deputy director has been the target of criticism by President Trump But he was also involved in an incident with the White House early last year that raised questions about whether he and the bureau were trying to damage the president In an excerpt from my new book Media Madness: Donald Trump The Press and the War Over the Truth I describe events that unfolded last year beginning with a conversation between McCabe and the thenWhite House chief of staff:xa0 Reince Priebus was chairing a 7:30 am intelligence meeting when one of the participants Andrew McCabe asked to speak to him privately McCabe the deputy FBI director closed the door and told Priebus: “We want you to know that everything in this New York Times story is bull” The Times had quoted unnamed sources in reporting that Trump campaign aides and associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials CNN had carried a similar report Priebus pointed to the three televisions on his office wall: “Here’s my problem they’re going 247 Can the FBI say what you just told me” McCabe said he would have to check Priebus thought he might come out of this a freaking hero A few hours later McCabe told him the bureau couldn’t start the practice of commenting on newspaper stories or it would never end “Give me a break” Priebus said “I’m getting crushed all over the place and you won’t say publicly what you told me privately” James Comey called later “We really can’t do anything about it” the FBI director told him But Comey said he’d be willing to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee that the charges were bogus he was sure its members would repeat that for the cameras Now a week later CNN was airing a breaking news story naming Priebus According to “multiple US officials” the network said “the FBI rejected a White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump’s associates and Russians known to US intelligence” Priebus was stunned by the implication that he was pressuring law enforcement Had he been set up Why was the FBI leaking this information when one of its top officials had initiated the conversation Comey assured Priebus that afternoon that he hadn’t done anything wrong but the story reverberated for days “Is Reince Priebus Lying About the FBI” Slate asked “Reince Priebus Should Resign” a Boston Globe columnist demanded The damage was done Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at @HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurt zxa0 Trending in Politics

Associate Partner Budget 2018 To Test Investors Faith In Modi Government To keep investors confidence  PM Modis government will need to be seen containing the fiscal deficit while also increasing spending in key areas of the slowing economy Budget 2018 | Thomson Reuters | Updated: January 31 2018 15:18 IST 33 Shares PRINT COMMENTS To keep investors confidence PM Modis government will need to be seen containing the fiscal deficit Mumbai: Since his election four years ago the markets have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modis campaign to mend patchy public finances and develop new areas of growth in Asias third largest economy To keep investors confidence however PM Modis government will need to be seen containing the fiscal deficit while also increasing spending in key areas of the slowing economy Markets will be focused on how much the country widens its fiscal deficit beyond the 3 per cent of gross domestic product GDP projected for 201819 A Reuters poll showed most economists expect a 32 per cent deficit as the government looks to increase investments in key areas such as agriculture to bolster its reelection prospects in elections due by 2019 A modest widening of that nature would calm investors worried that the government may slip away from its judicious spending Traders say bond yields could fall 10 to 15 basis points while shares could hit new record highs Gains could be more pronounced if the government sticks to its 30 per cent target But a deficit above 32 per cent could hit shares and send bond yields up by 2025 basis points depending on the size of the blowout on fears of populist policy ahead of next years elections Markets remain nervous after the governments annual Economic Survey on Monday suggested a pause in fiscal consolidation sending bonds plummeting I think the budget will be focused on both investors as well as the common man said A Balasubramanian chief executive officer at Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management adding that he expects a deficit of 32 per cent The government will take care so that the budget is neither inflationary nor fiscally less prudent A prudent budget could also soothe the Reserve Bank of India which holds a policy review on February 67 amid worries it could raise rates in coming months after inflation hit a 17month high in December well above its 4 per cent target Critical juncture Benchmark 10year bond yields have fallen 135 bps and the NSE share index has surged 55 per cent since PM Modi took power in May 2014 But a recent spike in inflation tightening cash conditions and worries about fiscal slippage have sent the 10year bond yield up more than 80 basis points since July the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis Stocks have been more resilient gaining 49 per cent this year and hitting records amid signs earnings are recovering after years of poor performance While investors expect some spending to support an economy thats expected to post its weakest growth in four years they will want to see such stimulus is wellfinanced Growth has been hampered by the rollout of Goods and Service Tax GST last year and a shock move to ban high value currency notes in late 2016 which hit tax revenues and increased the chances the fiscal deficit shortfall would hit 32 per cent target for the year to March An expected pickup in growth next fiscal year and state asset sales estimated to raise Rs 1 lakh crore $1574 billion should boost tax revenues Despite an expected revenue increase investors dont believe the government will swing to profligacy with a rally in oil prices likely to constrain government spending The country imports 80 per cent of its energy requirements and the government may need to respond to higher crude prices like it did in October by cutting fuel duties The risk that such a contingency is needed could keep the government in check

after they were sworn in in 2016 Rob GriffithAP Australias government is holding an urgent investigation into how hundreds of classified documents about the interior workings of several recent

years some of them refer to current members of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls Cabinet The ABC began publishing parts of the files this week revealing the embarrassing inner workings of government —

unsupervised Dubbing the documents the Cabinet Files  the network calls it one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history adding that the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing Among the revelations from the files: Former immigration minister Scott Morrison whos currently Turnbulls treasurer acted in late 2013 to limit the number of approved asylum seekers by arranging to delay security checks so that people close to being granted permanent protection would miss the deadline — a move that reportedly affected 30 asylum seekers each week Looking to cut spending under Prime Minister Tony Abbott his top treasury and finance officials considered denying welfare to anyone whos under 30 A range of scenarios were considered that targeted

secondhand shop The cabinets were bought cheap the network says because they were locked and the keys had been lost Inside the cabinets were records of five separate governments that spanned nearly 10 years some of them refer to current members of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls Cabinet The ABC began publishing parts of the files this week revealing the embarrassing inner workings of government — and today reporting that the trove of documents also include references to at least two other previously unknown breaches in which hundreds more secret and sensitive documents were either lost or left unsupervised Dubbing the documents the Cabinet Files  the network calls it one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history adding that the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing Among the revelations from the files: Former immigration minister Scott Morrison whos currently Turnbulls treasurer acted in late 2013 to limit the number of approved asylum seekers by arranging to delay security checks so that people close to being granted permanent protection would miss the deadline — a move that reportedly affected 30 asylum seekers each week Looking to cut spending under Prime Minister Tony Abbott his top treasury and finance officials considered denying welfare to anyone whos under 30 A range of scenarios were considered that targeted job snobs the ABC says but the plan was shelved over a potential backlash After controversial commentator Andrew Bolt was successfully accused of breaking the Racial Discrimination Act in 2011 the Cabinet later asked Bolt about changing the laws unreasonably restrictive reach — and was the only person specifically named as having been consulted the ABC says citing draft legislation that is part of the files Nearly 200 topsecret code word protected and sensitive documents were left in the office of senior minister Penny Wong when Labor lost the 2013 election the ABC says The materials dealt with topics ranging from details of counterterrorism operations to how to defend the United Arab Emirates from Iran Those documents were eventually found by security staff who saw them destroyed Nearly 400 national security files went missing from the Australian Federal Police over the course of five years from 20082013 The ABC says those classified records were from the powerful National Security Committee NSC of the cabinet which controls the countrys security intelligence and defense agenda The cabinet secretariats general practice was to give up searching and write off lost documents if they could not be found after repeated attempts When ABC began publishing some of the news from the documents this week it triggered speculation about a possible leak in the current government that Turnbull has led since 2015 But the network says there was no leak and that no one broke the law — instead someone finally got around to drilling out the locks on the two heavy cabinets that had been sold without any matching keys The documents were in two locked filing cabinets sold at an exgovernment sale in Canberra the ABC says A nifty person drilled the locks and uncovered the trove of documents inside The cabinets and their contents were bought for small change in a sale that could have been made to anyone the network says It adds The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade Nearly all the files are classified some as top secret or AUSTEO which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only The ABC isnt releasing any names or details about who bought the old informationrich cabinets or how it learned about them Citing confidential sources the network says it will protect their privacy at all costs After news of the massive security breach broke the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provided no more details releasing a statement saying only that its looking into the

Author: Sujatha Perepa IBM Sujatha Perepa IBM Why the US Government is Moving to Cloud Computing Image: opensourcewayFlickr It’s no secret that cloud computing is transforming businesses across industries and creating a paradigm shift by delivering hosted services through the internet with unabated cost benefits and business innovation But while the private sector is building on cloud computing’s myriad benefits government organizations have also aggressively begun to capitalize on them As an IBM solution architect and a trusted advisor to many of our government sector customers I’ve seen how the financial constraints of the past five years have deeply affected how agencies deploy their solutions These agencies are pressed to seek optimized business models while measuring their performance and service deliveries more closely — hence their inclination towards shared services While cloud deployments are mainly considered to contain costs by sharing services and infrastructures government agencies have also devised innovative means of ensuring compliance across the enterprise FedRAMP for example They’ve also been able to lower barriers to new business creation Additionally cloud adoption is helping governments to improve business flexibility despite their backend silo systems The US Army Air Force Navy DOJ USDA Department of Education and more have been early cloud adopters setting the trend and direction for others to follow The federal government isn’t solely relying on the same cloud computing model that hosts some of your favorite consumer applications delivered via the cloud like Netflix or Instagram The private cloud environments they operate in definitely leverage some of the characteristics of elasticity in those public clouds but they need to be more reliable to handle mission critical workloads That’s why IDC says that by FY 2014 US Federal government spending on private cloud will be $17 billion vs just $1183 million on public cloud Government organizations are redefining their businesses to deliver improved citizen services According to the US Federal Cloud Computing Strategy  the US government instituted the CloudFirst policy to accelerate the pace of cloud adoption This document promotes the service management innovation and adoption of emerging technologies According to this document “focus will shift from the technology itself to the core competencies and mission of the agency” Many agencies must support their missioncritical operations with agile and innovative cloud deployments that incorporate mobile social and analytics technologies However they also have to take stringent compliance and security measures FISMA FIPS and FedRAMP mandates to not compromise on national security from inside and outside threats Examples of Crucial Government Services on Cloud Some of the key areas we’re seeing focus from the US Federal government include: IT consolidation: Government agencies realize the benefits of IT consolidation to increase operational efficiencies They are reducing the cost of IT ownership by consolidating their server footprints through cloud and virtualization efforts Similarly datacenter consolidation is taking place to reduce hardware costs and also to drastically reduce the energy consumption by many fold Shared services: More government agencies are leaning towards sharing IT services to reduce costs and to improve business process efficiencies Some of the key federal programs seeking IaaS and SaaS solutions include continuous monitoring asset management threat & fraud detection and prevention programs Because these cloud adoption models allow the flexibility to deploy more current services with elastic capacity the government programs are become increasingly agile and responsive to changing business conditions Citizen services: Almost all federal state and local agencies provide a variety of citizen servicesself services For example allowing citizens to monitor their energy and water consumption can help them be more vigilant of their usage Accessing the status of their service requests applications loans etc and even their medical records along with the informative wiki resources to improve consumer awareness is pivotal for everyonexa0 The Open Government Initiative is a classic example of informing and empowering the citizens through dashboards and scorecards about government and the flagship initiatives There’s a great opportunity to learn more about how cloud computing is transforming the government coming up in early October Please join IBM for the Federal Cloud Innovation Forum on Oct 22 in Washington DC at the Willard Hotel Former US Secretary of State and retired fourstar US Army general Colin Powell will deliver the keynote address Click here to view the conference details and registration info Sujatha Perepa is an IBM software client architect for national security and justice and law enforcement agencies in the US government Originally posted by:

Bill targeting gunfree zones stalls in House committee By DAVE SOLOMON January 30 2018 11:53PM CONCORD — A bill that would punish local officials for imposing gunfree zones on town or schoolowned property was held back by a legislative committee on Tuesday but that recommendation could be overturned when the full House votes next week The House Committee on Municipal and County Government voted 182 to refer the bill HB 1749  to interim study which means it’s dead for this year unless supporters can convince the full House to overturn the committee vote and pass the bill “I’ve seen 191 committee reports flipped before There have been numerous emails into the committee asking this bill to be passed” said Rep JR Hoell RDunbarton lead sponsor “There is real importance in passing this bill given the overreach we’ve seen in the local towns” The bill was promoted by some gun rights advocates who say municipalities are exceeding their authority with new ordinances that amount to local gun control measures They cite Milford selectmen for banning target shooting on town land and the Lebanon School Board which has voted to ban firearms on school property and at school events on any property Supporters of the bill say the change is necessary for the state to protect its jurisdiction over gun control and the rights of gun owners as they move from one municipality to another New Hampshire already has a law on the books giving the state exclusive control over firearms regulation and banning municipalities from imposing any of their own The attorney general agrees that towns do not have the legal authority to impose such regulations The question centers on whether the state will enforce the law nullify local ordinances and punish local officials for adopting them The original bill called for $5000 fines but a late amendment changes that penalty to $500 “The $5000 was copied from Florida statutes verbatim and our selectmen are paid less so maybe $500 is an appropriate level” said Hoell Committee Chairman James Belanger RHollis like other committee members said he has been inundated with emails on the bill and that many are now questioning why the state would block a school board from imposing a gunfree zone “The emails I’m getting now are raising the question of why we allow guns in schools” he said “We are awakening a sleeping giant” Gov Chris Sununu has said he does not think any additional gunrelated legislation is needed in the current session The House Majority Leader Richard Hinch RMerrimack registered his opposition to the bill dsolomon@unionleadercom

by AWR Hawkins 30 Jan 2018 0 30 Jan 2018 30 Jan 2018 Glamour magazine interviewed female gun owners during the NSSF SHOT Show then posted a story wherein the women explained why they support the Second Amendment Glamour asked all the women the same question “Why do you have a gun” The vast majority simply responded that they owned guns for “protection” or “selfdefense” But there those who owned guns for sport as well The women were asked how they react when people question the value of private gun ownership Twentyfouryearold Chrysti Ane said “My own personal belief is that I do feel safer with a gun” 38yearold Crystal said “If they don’t like it then don’t carry one” and 54yearold Charlene added “If you don’t like guns that’s fine Don’t tell me and don’t preach to me that ‘guns are bad’ and this and that Guns don’t kill people” Each woman was also asked “When mass shootings or school shootings happen—like the school shooting in Kentucky on January 23—does it ever make you rethink your position” The women predominantly answered “No” indicating that criminal misuse of firearms does not make them rethink their support of the Second Amendment Others went even further and explained that criminal misuse of firearms only bolsters their determination to armed to defend themselves should be they find themselves under attack Glamour quotes a University of Chicago National Opinion Research Center showing that more oneinten women owned a gun in 2014 And that number has certainly increaed as women were acquiring concealed carry permits at twice the pace of men duringxa0Barack Obama’s second termxa0 According to the Crime Prevention Research Center CPRC “The number of women with permits has increased twice as quickly as the number of men with permits from 2012 to 2016” CPRC also points to evidence which “suggests that permitholding is increasing about 75 percent more quickly among minorities than among whites” The bottom line gun ownership is no longer something enjoyed by white males only Rather men and women of all races and backgrounds have embraced the freedoms protected by the Second Amendment AWRxa0Hawkins is an awardwinning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News the hostxa0of the Breitbart podcastxa0 Bullets  and the writercurator ofxa0 Down Range with AWR Hawkins xa0a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment also for Breitbart News He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio Follow him on Twitter:xa0 @AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atxa0 awrhawkins@breitbartcom  Sign up to get Down Range atxa0 breitbartcomdownrange  Read More Stories About: Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbartcom and Facebook Visit Breitbarts Facebook Page  BREITBART CONNECT 
by AWR Hawkins 31 Jan 2018 0 31 Jan 2018 31 Jan 2018 South Dakota Republican Senators are pressing Govxa0Dennis Daugaard R to sign a bill removing a permit requirement for carrying a concealed handgun for selfdefense Breitbart News reported that similar legislation passed the SD House and Senate last year only to be vetoed by Daugaard The 2017 bill HB 1072 was brought to a vote byxa0Senator Brock Greenfield R2 He contended thatxa0the Second Amendment rights of South Dakota residents had basically been taken away by the state and were only given back to those who agreed to get a permit to carry Greenfield equated the permit requirement with being forced to “lease back one’s guaranteed Second Amendment right” from the state Similar arguments are being made for permitless carry in 2018 South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports that State Sen Lance Russell R30 is pushing legislation to abolish the permit requirement Russell is a former Fall River County state’s attorney who believes fining lawabiding citizens because their firearm becomes covered by a piece of clothing is ludicrous He said “I’ve brought this bill numerous times over the last ten years I’ve been in the legislature I’m hopeful this year we might have a chance to get it enacted into law” State Senxa0Arthur Rusch R17 opposes the push to eliminate a concealed permit requirement He says “I don’t believe that the remedy to our violent society is for everybody to be carrying guns I think that will merely exacerbate the problem” The sticking point with Rusch’s position is that handgun murders actually dropped in Alaska Arizona and Wyoming following the abolition of a permit requirement In other words the evidence does not support Rusch’s contention that ending the permit requirement leads to or even contributes to an increase in violence AWRxa0Hawkins is an awardwinning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News the hostxa0of the Breitbart podcastxa0 Bullets  and the writercurator ofxa0 Down Range with AWR Hawkins xa0a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment also for Breitbart News He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio Follow him on Twitter:xa0 @AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atxa0 awrhawkins@breitbartcom  Sign up to get Down Range atxa0 breitbartcomdownrange  xa0

by Ian Mason 14 Jan 2018 0 14 Jan 2018 14 Jan 2018 Dr Alveda King niece of Dr Martin Luther King Jr joined Breitbart News Sunday on the eve of her uncle’s namesake holiday hitting back at racism accusations against President Donald Trump and levying her own complaints against ultraliberal Facebook “I agree that President Trump is not a racist He has done so much” King told host and Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle “Just now … Trump signed the bill that was sponsored by Congressman John Lewis making the Martin Luther King Jr historic site in Atlanta a national park — the first park to be named after an AfricanAmerican man” King continued She defended the president against a rash of new “racism” accusations supposedly stemming from vulgar remarks Democratic staffers are claiming Trump made about thirdworld countries that send the United States massive numbers of immigrants She went on: And there’s all other kind of legislation and things that President Trump is passing including getting a lot of black folks out of jail — he’s working on doing that believe it or not and putting them back to work And putting America back to work — AfricanAmericans especially because our job rate or our hiring rate was so low and it’s going up along with everybody else’s rate So President Trump is not a racist He cares about America period And he said “No matter what color our skin is we all bleed red” So he sees black people all people as people He sees Americans as the people he is supposed to serve and he’s doing that And he is not a racist I just really want to say that Trump himself similarly dismissed the accusers which included Rep Lewis himself earlier Sunday King who has been increasingly active in conservative politics and reportedly voted for Trump in his presidential campaign backed him up saying “Trump cares about this country He cares about the plight of everybody who’s been underserved misserved mistreated and he’s equalizing that And he means that and I believe him I really do” King also expressed her frustration with tech giant Facebook who recently blocked the prolife Roe v Wade documentary — on which she is collaborating with other activists — from raising funds from the social media site’s ads “Facebook has been taking it down not letting the paid ads go forth and all that” King told Boyle “Trying to stop the message that’s overtaking this nation and that is that babies in the womb deserve civil rights like anybody else does Just because they are preborn or unborn they’re human beings” Facebook later yielded to pressure and allowed the team to crowdfund “What this movie does is to show the inhumanity against a certain class of people and that’s the little babies in the womb Why Facebook is blocking it” King asked “I guess some of their followers and people are just complaining about it because they don’t want that message to get out but the message in my opinion is now unstoppable” Looking forward to the national holiday named for her uncle Dr King explained that she and the King Center like xa0to consider Monday not a “day off” but a “day on” “We should take a ‘day on’ of learning to do what my uncle Martin Luther King Jr — I called him uncle ML — said: learn to live together as brothers and as sisters or perish together as fools” she told Boyle “We should begin to pray for peace and unity rather than in the 1960s when we protested and sometimes we were angry and things like that Well now to unite for peace we need to pray and seek unity” Read More Stories About: Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbartcom and Facebook Visit Breitbarts Facebook Page  BREITBART CONNECT

By Michael D Tanner This article appeared on National Review Online on January 31 2018 The Western world can breathe easy British prime minister Theresa May has solved one of the great crises of our time: She has appointed a Minister of Loneliness Tracey Crouch who is currently the Tory undersecretary for Sports and Civil Society will be charged with leading a governmentwide effort to “develop a strategy” for ending “loneliness and social isolation” among adults It is easy to have a laugh at the expense of the Brits of course although just last year President Obama’s surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review arguing that the societal problem of loneliness needs more attention from business and government But there is something bigger at work here There is now a general belief one increasingly shared by politicians and voters of both parties that every problem large or small can only be solved by the government The Declaration of Independence says that governments are instituted among men to secure our unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Today too many people see government as the solution to whatever ails us Expecting it to do so is a recipe for disaster Obesity a problem We need the government to regulate what we eat Wages too low The government should set them Are people doing things that you think are immoral Criminalize those things “There ought to be a law” has become the allpurpose political rallying cry And while omnipresent government may be the ethos of modern politics it does not come without a cost The most obvious one of course is the modern leviathan state We have a federal government that spends more than $4 trillion per year is $20 trillion in debt and regulates nearly every aspect of our lives State and local governments follow suit From our bedrooms to our businesses there seems no area of our lives that lawmakers don’t believe it is their job to oversee restrict subsidize or otherwise intrude upon This leaves us poorer of course but it also leaves us less free In the most recent Human Freedom Index which looks at both economic and personal liberties the United States ranks 17th As Gerald Ford once said “A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have” Moreover those who rely on government to solve all problems will likely be disappointed Most government programs are at best a failure and at worst do active harm to society and the people they purport to help As Milton Friedman once put it “If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert in five years there would be a shortage of sand” Civil society — that vast conglomeration of activity undertaken by individuals in the absence of government coercion — has proven to do far more good Yet insidiously our overreliance on government saps the vitality of civil society and nongovernment alternatives “If government is not seen as a legitimate source of intervention individuals and associations will respond” Charles Murray once noted “If instead government is permitted to respond government will seize the opportunity expand on it and eventually take over altogether” Moreover relying on government to solve every problem in society inevitably leads to political disagreements about how to solve those problems If everything in our lives becomes political then there is no respite from the political This can only increase the polarization of society driving Americans farther into their respective bunkers Obviously there is a proper role for government and the limits of that role will always be the subject of political debate But perhaps the next time we encounter a problem in society we should think twice before asking government to solve it for us 
By News Source Guyana on January 31 2018 In a full statement on the announcement last evening Mr Jagdeo said he has seen the reluctance of the government to offer specifics or periods related to the crime wave and he fears that there may be a move to use the inquiries to polorize the society Opposition Leader Bharrat Jagdeo while welcoming the Government’s announcement to conduct Commissions of Inquiry into the crime spree believes that the probes must be comprehensive and have international jurists serving on the Commissions The crime spree took place between 2002 and 2008 under the Jagdeo presidency Over 1400 Guyanese were murdered during that period In a full statement on the announcement last evening Mr Jagdeo said he has seen the “reluctance” of the government to offer specifics or periods related to the crime wave and he fears that there may be a move to use the inquiries to polorize the society “I believe that not wanting a comprehensive inquiry is an act of desperation by the Coalition Government to polarize our societyxa0xa0 Having failed to deliver on their promises of ‘clean government’ jobs for young people etc the Grangercabal is returning to ‘old politics’ to polarize our societyxa0 Guyanese society has known and remembers the efforts by the PNC to polarize our people” Jagdeo said The Opposition Leader and former President went on to state that “if anyone has an apology to make to our AfroGuyanese community it is the Grangercabal that allowed a village which was known for its progressive attributes to be captured and held hostage by criminals and allowed the atrocities committed on many of the young men and women of that village” President Granger was not involved in active politics during the 20022008 period But Mr Jagdeo is of the view that the governmentxa0should apologise to all the other victims of the criminals that were labeled as ‘Freedom Fighters’ “The fact is that many of the current leaders in the Coalition Government were complicit in many of these crimes Guyanese still recall their publicly announced quest to make the country ungovernable – a declaration made in Buxton For political gain the polarization of our people was the driving force of old politics” The Opposition Leader said he is making himself available to the government to provide an input in the crafting of the Terms of Reference for the Commissions However he noted that “this is providing that the Coalition Government is interested in ensuring that such an issue is dealt with in a bipartisan manner” According to Jagdeo “I maintain that once a Commission is credibly constituted it will be supported by the PPPC In the meantime I am of the view that our people must not be distracted by this more so as the acts of corruption failures and incompetence under the Coalition Government continue to be exposed by the political Opposition” Members of the first Commission to look into the crime spree period will be sworn in this morning Similar To This Article

reiterated that we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades SEE ALSO: Why it makes sense for Apple to drop 3D Touch from this years new iPhone As its being investigated by the US government Mashables received the following statement from Apple: About a year ago we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on certain iPhones with older batteries We know that iPhones have become an important part of the daily lives of our customers and our intention was to improve the customer experience We sought to further improve the customer experience in December by announcing a significant discount on replacement batteries for certain iPhones We also announced that we began developing a new iOS feature to show battery health and which would recommend when the user should consider replacing their battery These actions were taken to further assist our customers and help extend the life of their iPhones In addition users will be able to see if the power management feature is being used to prevent unexpected shutdowns and turn if off if they so choose These features will be included in a developer release next month and a user release this Spring As we told our customers in December we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love Making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them Following the throttling discovery Apple apologized to customers for failing to be more transparent about what was actually happening behind the scenes The company has since created several initiatives to correct its mistakes The first was to slash battery replacements for outofwarranty devices from $79 to $29  The second move is forthcoming in a future update iOS 113  set to be released sometime in the spring iOS 113 will include two important new features: 1 more detailed information on an iPhone batterys health and 2 a setting thatll let users turn off any automatic power management features As weve said

and Joshua Berlinger CNN Updated 2:15 AM EST Wed January 31 2018 CNN North Korea is planning to show off dozens of longrange missiles at a February 8 parade the day before the Winter Olympics is set to begin in South Korea two diplomatic sources with deep knowledge of North Koreas intentions told CNN Wednesday The display of hundreds of missiles and rockets would be an attempt to scare the hell out of the Americans one of the sources said The parade is expected to include dozens of intercontinentalrange Hwasong15 missiles which the North Koreans testfired for the first time in late November the sources said They also didnt rule out a missile test in the near future to send a strong message to American forces currently deployed in the region The news comes after US President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union speech during which he criticized the Kim Jong Un regimes human rights abuses and reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that could soon threaten the US homeland In his address Trump highlighted personal stories of victims of the Kim regime inviting as guests North Korean defector Ji Seongho and the parents of Otto Warmbier who died shortly after returning from North Korea where he spent 17 months in captivity Winter Olympics woes The interKorean talks which led to the Norths decision to participate in the Winter OIympics had been hailed as a breakthrough that could ease escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula However the process has not been smooth On Monday North Korea said it canceled a joint cultural performance that was to be held in advance of the Olympics in response to unflattering coverage by South Korean media According to a statement from South Koreas Unification Ministry the North Koreans pulled out because South Korean media continue to insult North Koreas genuine measures regarding the PyeongChang Olympics and take issues with its domestic festival The sources that spoke to CNN said that other planned events could be canceled Cracks Chad OCarroll managing director of the Korea Risk Group in Seoul said the planned military parade could undermine Washingtons support of dialogue between the two Koreas The ongoing US support for interKorean rapprochement already appears to be showing cracks and will likely be seriously tested in the event of a major DPRK ICBM parade on the eve of the Olympics he said Foreign media will be banned from covering the upcoming military parade the sources said This is a dramatic change from last year when many global news organizations were invited to cover a military parade in April that saw Pyongyang unveil new longrange missiles   A diplomatic source said this was due to the sensitivity of the weapons that will be on display and to avoid questions about the deploy ability of the missiles By banning foreign press North Korea controls all of the imagery the world sees North Korean state media in recent days has been increasing its antiUS rhetoric warning of grave consequences if p ostponed joint military exercises resume after the Olympics View this interactive content on CNNcom Policy divisions Earlier Tuesday sources told CNN that the Trump administration had decided not to nominate Victor Cha its widely rumored selection as US ambassador to South Korea apparently because of a difference over Korea policy specifically over its consideration of a preemptive strike Cha a widely respected former academic and former Bush administration official said in a Washington Post oped Monday that the answer to the real and unprecedented threats North Korea presents is not as some Trump administration officials have suggested a preventive military strike Instead Cha laid out what he called a forceful military option available that can address the threat without escalating into a war that would likely kill tens if not hundreds of thousands of Americans CNNs Elise Labott and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report2 Comments Brexit will leave the UK poorer under all plausible Brexit scenarios a secret leaked government assessment has reported with financial services one of the biggest losers outside the union The paper dated to this month and reportedly currently being shared within Whitehall was obtained by BuzzFeed UK and considers the implications of the three most likely settlements Leaving the European Union without a replacement deal in place would cost the UK 8% of potential growth over a 15 year period the paper concludes A comprehensive deal would mean a 5% hit over the same period while the softest option xa0remaining in the free market would mean 2% The latter two are however less serious than suggested by Treasury data ahead of the referendum which estimated they would cost the UK 62% and 38% of growth respectively The paper modelled the data under the assumption that the UK would rapidly complete a trade deal with the US The City car manufacturers and chemical suppliers would be among the businesses which would nonetheless suffer badly from a loss of trade access it concluded The paper has leaked as fullscale government conflict over Brexit has broken out in the past week with the prime minister distancing herself from a statement by chancellor Philip Hammond telling a Davos audience that Britain would seek a modest break from the EU  Backbench Brexiteers have since threatened mutiny and demanded that May commit herself to a hard divorce The internal turmoil within the top ranks of the Conservative party is increasingly being aired publically with climate change minister Claire Perry being called to account yesterday for describing hardline eurosceptics as ‘swivel eyed’ in a message sent to a group of colleagues She said that she used the terminology after MPs were described as traitors for not fully backing Brexit xa0‘The “sellout traitor mob” should be ignored’ Perry wrote  ‘Listening to them means wrecking the economy in the short term and via a Corbyn government delivering a long steady slow decline for the country we love ‘I would hypothesise that they are mostly elderly retired men who do not have mortgages schoolaged children or caring responsibilities so they represent the swiveleyed few not the many we represent’ Ministers were reportedly only being allowed to examine the document in a single room with no copies being shared or

on crutches Now he has a new leg pictwittercomXcO5KOOXE0 — Charlie Spiering @charliespiering January 31 2018 In 1996 Seongho was a starving boy in North Korea One day he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food In the process he passed out on the train tracks exhausted from hunger He woke up as a train ran over his limbs He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth Later he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians He had — and he resolved to be free Seongho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom Most of his family followed His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death Today he lives in Seoul where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most ‑ the truth Today he has a new leg but Seongho I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you’ve come Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all Seongho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves That they could chart their own destiny And that together they could light up the world That is what our country has always been about That is what Americans have always stood for always strived for and always done Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her Monuments to Washington and Jefferson — to Lincoln and King Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga — to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond And others who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one This Capitol This living monument to the American people A people whose heroes live not only in the past but all around us — defending hope pride and theAmerican way They work in every trade They sacrifice to raise a family They care for our children at home They defend our flag abroad They are strong moms and brave kids They are firefighters police officers border agents medics and Marines But above all else they are Americans And this

by Tom Fitton 31 Jan 2018Washington DC 0 31 Jan 2018 31 Jan 2018 A miracle! Judicial Watch files a federal lawsuit and the Justice Department finds the “missing” text messages! Of course as we said all along they were never missing in the first place On Wednesday we announced the filing of a Freedom of Information Act FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department for text messages and other records of FBI official Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page  Judicial Watch v US Department of Justice No 1:18cv00154 Sen Ron Johnson RWI chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee revealed in a letter dated January 20 that the FBI claimed it is unable to preserve text messages for a fivemonth period between December 14 2016 and May 17 2017 due to “misconfiguration issues” with FBIissued phones used by Strzok and Page The missing messages span dates between the presidential transition and the launch of Robert Mueller’s Russia probe where both Strzok and Page were employed So lo and behold right after we sued for the texts the Justice Department said it has found the texts According to Fox News  Inspector General Michael Horowitz reported that his office “succeeded in using forensic tools to recover text messages from FBI devices including text messages between Mr Strzok and Ms Page that were sent or received between December 14 2016 and May 17 2017” We sued after Justice failed to respond to our December 4 2017 FOIA request for: All records of communications including but not limited to emails text messages and instant chats between FBI official Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page All travel requests travel authorizations travel vouchers and expense reports of Peter Strzok All travel requests travel authorizations travel vouchers and expense reports of Lisa Page The text messages are of public interest because Strzok and Page were key investigators in the Clinton email and Trump Russia collusion investigations Strzok was reportedly removed from the Mueller investigative team in August and reassigned to a human resources position after it was discovered that he and FBI lawyer Lisa Page who worked for FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and with whom Strzok was carrying on an extramarital affair exchanged proClinton and antiTrump text messages Strzok reportedly oversaw the FBI’s interviews of the former national security adviser Gen Michael Flynn changed former FBI Director James Comey’s language about Hillary Clinton’s actions regarding her illicit email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless” played a lead role in the FBI’s interview of Clinton and is suspected of being responsible for using the unverified dossier to obtain a FISA warrant in order to spy on President Trump’s campaign The StrzokPage text messages are potentially responsive to several pending Judicial Watch FOIA lawsuits but showing the agency’s contempt for transparency and the rule of law the FBI has yet to produce any of the records explain the missing records to the courts or otherwise be forthcoming about these newly disclosed materials I did not believe for one minute that the StrzokPage texts were really missing For example the IRS told us that Lois Lerner’s emails were “missing” and we forced them to admit they existed and deliver them to us The State Department hid the Clinton emails but our FOIA lawsuits famously blew open that coverup It is shameful that the FBI and DOJ have been playing shell games with these smoking gun text messages We hope to get these messages through our lawsuit and we will be sure to let you know when we do!

combination of legitimate authority with authorized forcexa0 Without right human beings are not governed they are merely overpoweredxa0 Without might human beings are not governed they are merely admonished xa0 The moral authority of government its legitimacy derives in part from the fact that it has the consent of the governedxa0 It is constitutional government the rule of law not personsxa0 The people consent to a constitution which creates the primary office of citizenship and set out the individual offices citizens may hold and the powers of those officesxa0 They do so implicitly when they formally accept a proposed constitutionxa0 They do so implicitly when they participate in the process but decline to accept a particular constitutions or fail to leave the state when the constitution is adoptedxa0 When they accept the benefits of government and their consent is deemedxa0 The people then participate in the formation of the laws by which they are governedxa0 Citizenship is not enoughxa0 The suffrage must extend politically to all who are capable of giving their consent: all adult men and women regardless of race creed orientation or religious belief That is political justice: treating equals equally to the extent of their equality in this case their equal capacity for selfgovernance Suffrage is not enoughxa0 The politically free can be economically exploitedxa0 A just government regulates the economy to serve interest of human beings and provides just laws to ensure human beings receive a decent not minimal standard of living whether that be through programs maximizing full employment income supplements or combinations of bothxa0 This is economic justice: treating equals equally to the extent of their equality in this case their equality as human beings in need of some measure of wealth in order to discharge adequately their moral and political obligationsxa0 It does not require an equality of results beyond that floor of a decent standard of livingxa0 Economic justice recognizes that once a basic equality of economic conditions is established equality demands treating unequals unequally to the extent of their inequality in this case those who contribute more to the production of wealth are entitled to a greater share of that wealthxa0 But this situation only arises when all are truly economically free by having a decent standard of living and political laws effectively prevent the distortion of the political process by economic sources of power xa0 Authorized force is never violence The executive and the legislative branches of government implement their authority through the judiciaryxa0 Courts resolve conflicts and impose their just will through the police and sheriffsxa0 Violence is the unauthorized forcexa0 xa0 A federal democratic republic of the world with an entrenched bill of rights is within our graspxa0 All that is required is to the nations of world to surrender their external sovereignty their socalled right to make war with one anotherxa0 They would necessarily retain their internal sovereignty of their government in purely national mattersxa0 It is no longer a utopian fantasyxa0 A world community based on the recognition of a common human nature and the natural moral rights and obligations that flow thereafter is rapidly formingxa0 International problems are rapidlyu expanding The need for such an institution is substantial and pressing It is not the creation of a perfect society merely a healthy global society where conflict is resolved through law and not war It is only a question of prudence in timingxa0 Prudence involves the navigation between two extremesxa0 Western democracies successfully navigated similar problems with the extension of the franchise to nonpropertied and uneducated whites blacks and women in the later 19th and early 20th centuriesxa0 One is the error of supposing peace can be established by world political institutions prior to the moral and intellectual changes needed to make those institutions sufficiently acceptable to enough peoplexa0 The other is the error of supposing the heart and mind of man must be completely ready before the necessary institutions can be initiatedxa0 Both the institutionalists and the moralists fail to see that the process is interactivexa0 Human beings must be morally and intellectually ready for the institutions but only to some degreexa0 Once the institutions exist they will condition the whole social environment and produce further moral and intellectual changes favourable to their operationxa0 The moralist underestimates the educative influence of political institutionsxa0 The institutionalist does not pay enough attention to the psychological soil in which the institutions take root xa0 Rob Sutherland

Canada’s Telecoms and National Media Want the Government to Block Piracy Websites Digital rights groups worry that website blocking could cover more than illegal piracy Jan 30 2018 5:14pm Image: Shutterstock Composition:xa0Author As the US dismantles net neutrality protections for the internet a powerful group of Canadian telecom companies cultural organizations one labour union and the national broadcaster are all lining up behind a proposal that would allow the government to block access to websites that illegally host pirated content within Canada The proposal has raised the ire of digital rights activists in Canada who believe that such provisions constitute censorship and could be used to block access to legitimate content The coalition called FairPlay Canada  was unveiled on Monday That day the group also filed an application to the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission CRTC asking the federal regulator to create an Independent Piracy Review Agency that will “consider applications identifying piracy sites” and recommend websites serving pirated content to the CRTC which would then order internet service providers to block their customers’ access to those websites “We’re really worried about the idea that there’s inevitably going to be false positives and legitimate things are going to be caught up in that” Lauren Tribe executive director of nonprofit advocacy group OpenMedia  said over the phone “As soon as we open the door for the government to decide what we can and can’t see online I think we’re going to see a lot of lobby groups pushing to see their interests protected by this agency as well” Precise numbers on piracy in Canada are hard to come by but according to CRTC data cited in The Globe and Mail cable IPTV and satellite subscriptions declined by 400000 between 2012 and 2016 As for what that’s meant for profits the CRTC reported that broadcasting sector revenues dropped 14 percent in the same time period FairPlay Canada cites a 2017 report from antipiracy company MUSO that claims piracy websites received 188 billion visits from Canadians in 2016 The FairPlay Canada coalition and its application come at a crucial time for net neutrality—the principle that information on the internet should flow freely and without interference from service providers In the US the Federal Communications Commission FCC recently voted to repeal Obamaera net neutrality protections  Weeks before the vote Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that he would “defend net neutrality” Read More: Justin Trudeau Is ‘Very Concerned’ With FCC’s Plan to Roll Back Net Neutrality In September telecom giant Bell now a member of FairPlay Canada proposed website blocking at NAFTA negotiations  Other members of the coalition include the CBC Canada’s national broadcaster Rogers one of the “big three” telecom companies which also owns numerous media properties labour union Unifor and the Toronto International Film Festival among other companies and organizations “For us its a question of principle” Douglas Chow a CBC spokesperson wrote me in an email “We support efforts like FairPlay Canada to stop piracy of copyrighted content Groups who steal and resell content without permission are breaking the law and undermining financial support for culture” FairPlay Canada’s application resembles provisions in the US Stop Online Piracy Act SOPA proposed legislation that would have allowed internet service providers to block access to websites providing pirated content The Act was ultimately abandoned by lawmakers in 2012 after pressure from digital rights groups and the public but the industry continues to push for SOPAlike provisions in various forms  When asked if the CBC’s membership in FairPlay Canada would require disclosure in future news stories around website blocking Chow replied “A CBCRadioCanada journalist independently reports on any organization including us” The pressure on federal regulators now is immense as it must now review FairPlay Canada’s application Indeed most of Canada’s most important telecommunications and media organizations are now pushing a governmentadministered website blocking scheme The internet in Canada is at a crossroads

Chinese government exerts influence across Australian society MPs told Submission to parliamentary committee details how Communist party front groups influence business politics and education Tue 30 Jan 2018 1842xa0EST Last modified on Tue 30 Jan 2018 1843xa0EST Share on Messenger Close Chinese government front groups monitor ‘the thoughts and behaviours of the 130000 Chinese students on campuses across Australia’ according to a submission to a parliamentary committee Photograph: Dean LewinsAAP The Chinese government uses a sophisticated network of supposedly nonpolitical organisations to suppress criticism cultivate relationships and exert influence over Australia’s business academic and political worlds MPs investigating foreign interference have been handed evidence with unprecedented detail of the complex network of soft power used by extensions of the Chinese Communist party in boardrooms and on university campuses across Australia The submission by prominent Charles Sturt University author and ethicist Professor Clive Hamilton and Australian National University researcher Alex Joske says China uses its United Front Work Department to exert its influence on Australian society Reports of Chinese influence on Australia hysterical paranoia Peoples Daily says Read more United Front’s purpose Hamilton said is to “mobilise sympathetic or potentially sympathetic Chinese community groups to serve the interests of the CCP” while marginalising those opposed to the party Its influence extends across Chinese associations on university campuses and the CSIRO  Chinese Students and Scholars Associations Hamilton says in his submission to the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security was “the core of Beijing’s presence on university campuses” and an “integral component” of United Front activity in Australia with the primary purpose of “monitoring the thoughts and behaviours of the 130000 Chinese students on campuses across Australia” There are Hamilton said at least 37 associations currently active on Australian campuses “covering nearly all Australian universities  including all Group of Eight universities as well as the CSIRO” “CSSAs play a central role in the Chinese government’s efforts to monitor control and intervene in the lives of Chinese students in Australia and to limit academic freedom on universities” the submission states While some of the associations “attempt to downplay or hide the fact that they are guided by the Chinese government” others are more explicit The University of Newcastle’s website states that the campus association is “supervised by the Chinese general consulate Sydney” Hamilton says the associations are tasked with ensuring Chinese students “remain patriotic and supportive” of Communist party rule but are also used to mobilise Chinese students to oppose activities on campuses that might embarrass Beijing “As the Chinese government’s ears and eyes on university campuses CSSAs are likely behind many of the incidents of students and lecturers being reported to Chinese authorities for comments that run contrary to the party line” the submission stated He cited a recent example where the Chinese consulategeneral entered a dispute with the University of Newcastle after a lecturer showed a table that listed Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries The submission also details how the influence of proBeijing organisations in Australian business has been “supercharged” by the rapid growth in trade and investment flows between China and Australia You should consider our feelings: for Chinese students the state is an extension of family | Merriden Varrall Read more “Many leading figures in the Australian business community now serve as megaphones for Beijing’s messaging to the Australian government and the wider public not least in warnings about ‘damaging the relationship’ and the risks of retaliation when statements are made that Beijing does not like” the submission states It details “a proliferation of front organisations whose purpose is to deepen personal relationships … and subtly shift the perspective of the Australian business community” including the AustralianChina Belt & Road Initiative which is linked to Australia’s former trade minister Andrew Robb The ACBRI is partially funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but said in a statement that it “does not accept funding from Chinese government or Chinese companies and operates with full disclosure” to DFAT But in the submission Hamilton questions whether the foreign interference bill – which contains secrecy provisions which could see journalists and whistleblowers jailed for 20 years – would actually help to combat Chinese government influence “It is not clear that the legislation as currently framed would capture some of the more important foreign interference operations that are being undertaken by the PRC People’s Republic of China in Australia including the United Front work” the submission states The bill aims to target “covert deceptive or threatening actions by foreign actors who intend to influence Australia’s democratic or government processes or to harm Australia” Author vows book exposing Chinese influence will go ahead after publisher pulls out Read more But Hamilton said the notion of “influence” was difficult to measure and that while “blatant” cases might be captured by the act most forms of Chinese government influence are subtler He gave examples of instances which would “naturally be thought of as foreign interference operations but which may not be successfully prosecuted under the new laws” such as a university publisher rejecting a manuscript critical of the Chinese Communist party because it fears losing revenue from Chinese students and research collaborations with Chinese universities Last year publisher Allen & Unwin cancelled plans to publish Hamilton’s book about the Chinese government’s methods of asserting influence in Australia because of fears the Chinese government could sue for defamation Topics 
Chris SchwarzGovernment of Alberta Last year the National Council for Canadian Muslims sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a simple request: declare January 29 the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia It seemed like a reasonable suggestion The date is the day that Alexandre Bissonnette’s attack killed six worshippers in a Quebec City mosque While police have yet to confirm the motivation for the shooting Trudeau has called it an act of terrorism and many have linked the attack with rising Islamophobic sentiment in Canada Parliament also declares days for an array of different things some serious and some not It has declared a day commemorating the victims of terrorism a day to remember fallen police officers and a day to honour the fiddle Allin Parliament has designated more than seventy days for various reasons Rabbi Jonah Rank took to the Canadian Jewish News to encourage Canada’s Jewish community to get behind the proposal A litany of Muslim groups and other faith groups signed off on the open letter to the prime minister Yet NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was the only prominent political leader to endorse the idea The prime minister dithered “I think it’s important to underline intolerance directed at people of faith but we want to avoid that type of backlash that we’ve seen when we take these kinds of actions because unfortunately there is still a small intolerant minority” he said during an interview on RadioCanada’s Frenchlanguage morning show Première heure in January While Trudeau told the station he was still in “reflection” on the decision it seems obvious now that the government has opted not to make the declaration And that feels like a win not only for that “small intolerant minority” but for Conservatives who have only been too happy to craft this political moment as cover for standing against something that for so long has been evident: Islamophobia much like discrimination against other religious minorities needs to be actively opposed In a statement to The Walrus a spokesperson for leader Andrew Scheer wrote “The Conservative Party is open and inclusive and we support efforts to remember the victims of this heinous attack and stand firmly against religious discrimination” Despite that supposed openness though the party won’t be supporting the call from the Muslim congress They’ll be introducing a motion today to call January 29 the “National Day of Solidarity with Victims of AntiReligious Bigotry and Violence” Their plan in essence is to whitewash mention of Muslims and Islamophobia on a day meant to commemorate an attack on Canadian Muslims’ place of worship It’s not a surprising move from the Conservatives given the party has railed against the very word at the heart of this issue: Islamophobia Last year a Liberal backbench MP put forward motion M103 which decried Islamophobia and called on the House of Commons to study its root causes—indeed the root causes behind all systemic racism—and come up with a plan to combat it Farright groups in Canada weren’t happy “No special treatment Islamophobia brings Sharia” read one protester’s sign in Toronto Others waved around placards with cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed At some of the demonstrations the antiM103 protesters clashed with counterprotesters from antifa to hijabclad women brandishing their own signs: “Muslim lives matter” The Conservatives added their voices to that chorus offering an array of different reasons as to why they planned to vote against M103 only two Conservative MPs broke rank and voted for the motion The Conservatives insisted that they supported efforts to fight antiMuslim bias They just could not as Andrew Scheer put it back then support a motion which “does not define Islamophobia” A lack of definition he contended means the word could be broadened or abused to stifle free speech It’s a notion that kept cropping up Conservative MP David Anderson said during debate “There are many in the radical community who are trying to use this phrase as a catchall” Even MP and Conservativeleadership runnerup Maxime Bernier who admitted that there was no threat to free speech posed by M103 refused to support it because it did not define Islamophobia M103 was a nonbinding motion meaning it wouldn’t actually change anything about Canadian law so concerns about a lack of a definition were at best misplaced What’s more the Conservatives when in power had adopted the Ottawa Protocol on Combating Antisemitism a document calling on governments worldwide to fight antiSemitism—although it doesn’t like M103 provide a clear definition for that word During the M103 debate MP David Sweet read out loud from a National Post column from writer Raheel Raza in which she explains her opposition to the word contending: “The term Islamophobia was created in the 1990s when groups affiliated to the US Muslim Brotherhood decided to play victim for the purpose of beating down critics” Search through the debates and committee transcripts from the House of Commons or within the pages of the Toronto Sun and this odd notion that the word Islamophobia itself is some product of a global Muslim conspiracy keeps coming up Opponents of M103 pushed this idea that Canadian Muslims somehow at the behest of the shadowy brotherhood were looking to overhaul Canadian laws to criminalize criticism of Islam It’s apparently this fear that’s keeping the Conservative party from supporting the day of commemoration Empowering the word Conservatives say would stifle free speech and discourage legitimate criticism of some sects of Islam or some Muslimmajority countries—though they’ve offered no real explanation for why any of that would happen While Trudeau was happy to go allin on the fight of M103 he seems less inclined to jump into the fray on declaring a day commemorating the violent deaths of six men all of whom were killed merely because they happened to be attending Sunday prayers The truth is there is little substance behind the idea the word Islamophobia is some sort of Trojan horse It is neither a new word nor a particularly controversial term at least not until recently “For some of us on the Commission it was a new term a rather ugly term and we were not sure how it would be received” reads a 1997 report from the UK’s Runnymede Trust “However it is evident from the responses which we received that Islamophobia describes a real and growing phenomenon—an ugly word for an ugly reality” The trust which bills itself as the UK’s leading raceequality think tank admits it did not create the term although it did bring it into the mainstream “It was already in use among sections of the Muslim community as a term describing the prejudice and discrimination which they experience in their everyday lives” wrote Gordon Conway in the forward The report offers a concise definition as: “dread or hatred of Islam—and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims” In 2001 at an international forum in Stockholm hundreds of officials from dozens of countries—including Canada’s justice minister of the day Irwin Cotler—agreed to a declaration calling on all countries to “combat genocide ethnic cleansing racism antisemitism Islamophobia and xenophobia and to combat all racial discrimination and the intolerance associated with it” Nobody seemed too hung up on the matter of definitions then Indeed the Conservative in the House of Commons who seemed so concerned about the lack of definitions today didn’t appear worried when in 2016 they unanimously supported a motion “condemning all forms of Islamophobia” It is decidedly curious and maybe a little too convenient that opposition to the term has sprung up now What is surprising however is that Trudeau has opted to sit on the sidelines this time around preferring to fight intolerance by not angering the intolerant About the Authors Justin Ling  @Justin_Ling  is a

Turnbull’s government is looking into how hundreds of secret documents were left inside two large cabinets that were sold He’s seen here with members of his cabinet after they were sworn in in 2016 Rob GriffithAP toggle caption Rob GriffithAP Australia’s government is holding “an urgent investigation” into how hundreds of classified documents about the interior workings of several recent administrations found their way to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation The ABC says the thousands of pages of documents had been left in two filing cabinets — which the government then sold off at a secondhand shop The records were bought cheap the network says because they were locked and the keys had been lost Inside the cabinets were records of five separate governments that spanned nearly 10 years some of them refer to current members of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s Cabinet The ABC began publishing parts of the files this week revealing the embarrassing inner workings of government — and today reporting that the trove of documents also include references to at least two other previously unknown breaches in which hundreds more secret and sensitive documents were either lost or left unsupervised Dubbing the documents the Cabinet Files the network calls it “one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history” — adding that “the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing” Among the files’ revelations: Former immigration minister Scott Morrison who’s currently Turnbull’s treasurer acted in late 2013 to limit the number of approved asylum seekers by arranging to “delay security checks so that people close to being granted permanent protection would miss the deadline” — a move that reportedly affected 30 asylum seekers each week Looking to cut spending under Prime Minister Tony Abbott his top treasury and finance officials considered denying welfare to anyone who’s under 30 A range of scenarios were considered that targeted “job snobs” the ABC says — but the plan was shelved over a potential backlash After controversial commentator Andrew Bolt was successfully accused of breaking the Racial Discrimination Act in 2011 the cabinet later asked Bolt about changing the law’s “unreasonably restrictive” reach — and “was the only person specifically named as having been consulted” the ABC says citing draft legislation that is part of the files “Nearly 200 topsecret code word protected and sensitive documents were left in the office of senior minister Penny Wong when Labor lost the 2013 election” the ABC says The materials dealt with topics ranging from details of counterterrorism operations to how to defend the United Arab Emirates from Iran Those documents were eventually found by security staff who saw them destroyed Nearly 400 national security files went missing from the Australian Federal Police over the course of five years from 20082013 The ABC says those classified records were from “the powerful National Security Committee NSC of the cabinet which controls the country’s security intelligence and defense agenda” “The cabinet secretariat’s general practice was to give up searching and write off lost documents if they could not be found” after repeated attempts When ABC began publishing some of the news from the documents this week it triggered speculation about a possible leak in the current government that Turnbull has led since 2015 But the network says there was no leak and that no one broke the law — instead someone finally got around to drilling out the locks on the two heavy cabinets that had been sold without any matching keys “The documents were in two locked filing cabinets sold at an exgovernment sale in Canberra” the ABC says “A nifty person drilled the locks and uncovered the trove of documents inside” The cabinets and their contents were bought “for small change” in a sale that could have been made to anyone the network says It adds “The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade Nearly all the files are classified some as ‘top secret’ or ‘AUSTEO’ which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only” The ABC isn’t releasing any names or details about who bought the old informationrich cabinets or how it learned about them Citing confidential sources the network says it will “protect their privacy at all costs” After news of the massive security breach broke the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provided no more details releasing a statement saying only that it’s looking into “the circumstances around the disposal of two Commonwealth Government filing cabinets that allegedly contained classified material” Under Australian law the Cabinet records would have become public only after at least 20 years had passed But thanks to those other more common cabinets they’re being scrutinized now Let’s block ads!

might stumble over tension Reuters Staff 3 Min Read BEIRUT Reuters  Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Wednesday the work of Prime Minister Saad alHariri’s government work could be obstructed by political tension alManar TV reported as a row involving President Michel Aoun showed no signs of abating Aoun’s soninlaw Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil was caught on camera calling Berri “a thug” earlier this week causing protests in Beirut and gunfire near offices of Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement FPM east of the capital on Monday “The government will continue but it might stumble because of the current political tension” alManar controlled by the powerful Shi‘ite group Hezbollah cited Berri as saying The row has worsened a standoff between Berri a Shi‘ite and Aoun a Maronite Christian that threatens to ignite sectarian tensions in the runup to a parliamentary election in May The FPM said on Tuesday that Bassil had already expressed regret for the comments and that it regarded the issue as over But Berri in comments to MPs on Wednesday pressed his demand for an apology “to the Lebanese” for “the insults that happened” Berri and Aoun both in their 80s were enemies in the 197590 civil war Berri and Aoun’s parties are two of the most powerful groups in the coalition government that was formed in 2016 Lebanon has suffered long periods of paralysis in government as a result of political tensions in recent years “The constitutional institutions not the street are the right venues to resolve political disputes” Aoun said on his official Twitter feed on Wednesday Political tensions between Berri and Aoun have been rising since December when Aoun signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of Shi‘ite Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil one of Berri’s closest aides The row has shattered a rare moment of national unity that saved Lebanon from strife during the crisis over Hariri’s shock resignation in November which he later rescinded The tensions have also shaken Aoun’s ties with the Iranbacked Shi‘ite group Hezbollah whose links to Berri and Amal run much deeper than its political alliance with the FPM which was

Apple slowed down aka throttled older iPhones  The US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are reportedly probing the company though Apple wouldnt confirm any specific agencies The tech giant however has denied any malicious intent and reiterated that we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades SEE ALSO: Why it makes sense for Apple to drop 3D Touch from this years new iPhone As its being investigated by the US government Mashables received the following statement from Apple: About a year ago we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on certain iPhones with older batteries We know that iPhones have become an important part of the daily lives of our customers and our intention was to improve the customer experience We sought to further improve the customer experience in December by announcing a significant discount on replacement batteries for certain iPhones We also announced that we began developing a new iOS feature to show battery health and which would recommend when the user should consider replacing their battery These actions were taken to further assist our customers and help extend the life of their iPhones In addition users will be able to see if the power management feature is being used to prevent unexpected shutdowns and turn if off if they so choose These features will be included in a developer release next month and a user release this Spring As we told our customers in December we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love Making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them Following the throttling discovery Apple apologized to customers for failing to be more transparent about what was actually happening behind the scenes The company has since created several initiatives to correct its mistakes The first was to slash battery replacements for outofwarranty devices from $79 to $29  The second move is forthcoming in a future update iOS 113  set to be released sometime in the spring iOS 113 will include two important new features: 1 more detailed information on an iPhone batterys health and 2 a setting thatll let users turn off any automatic power management features As weve said before the software update is a good olive branch to please upset customers but it may not be such a great idea LinkedIn OTTAWA — Long flights can be gruelling but those travelling on official government planes have limitless alcohol to take the edge off Between December 2016 and December 2017 passengers aboard government aircraft consumed 401 bottles of wine 584 cans of beer and five 250millilitre bottles of vodka at a total cost of $8179 The numbers were provided in answer to a question from Conservative MP Dean Allison Alcohol is provided free of charge for officials on international government flights According to the answer tabled in the House of Commons Tuesday “the service of nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages on the Airbus and 707 for official delegations on international flights has been a standard practice since the 1970s” Members of the media travelling on official flights pay a flat fee that covers all services including alcohol During Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s weeklong official trip to China last December more than $2200 worth of alcohol — 121 bottles of wine and 241 cans of beer — was consumed on flights That amount translates to about two bottles of wine and four cans of beer for each of the roughly 56 passengers for the flights to and from China During flights to and from Vietnam for Trudeau’s official visit last November the delegation of about 50 people drank 76 bottles of wine and 79 cans of beer worth $1685 When the prime minister visited Scotland in July the beer and wine was supplemented by four 250millilitre bottles of vodka Parliament Hill is a workplace in ‘crisis’ says labour minister But not every official flight is so boozy When former governor general David Johnston travelled to China last July the 40 passengers drank just 33 bottles of wine and 27 cans of beer — less than one of each per person with a total value of $632 The prime minister is required to fly on official government planes for security reasons During his official trips it’s routine for members of the media to fly with the official delegation Freeflowing alcohol is nothing new on these flights According to numbers provided by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s office $13605 worth of alcohol was consumed on official flights in 2013 and at least $12696 was consumed in 2014 under the previous Conservative government When Johnston travelled to South Africa in 2013 passengers drank 348 bottles of wine valued at $6621 Another $5839 worth of beer wine and vodka were consumed during the governor general’s trip to Poland the Netherlands and Belgium the following yearxa0 The numbers come as more people are speaking up about a culture of sexual harassment

Blockchain for Climate Change with New Coalition Home » Government » UN Researches Blockchain for Climate Change with New Coalition Comments On the 22nd of January the UN released a blog post announcing the creation of the Climate Change Coalition CCC The CCC’s purpose is to research use cases for blockchain technology and how it can help fight climate change The UN believes that blockchain technology can strengthen monitoring reporting and verification of the impacts of climate change by improving “transparency traceability and costeffectiveness of climate action” Blockchain technology can also build trust among climate actors and ensure that even the poorest can access incentive mechanisms for climate action The CCC will research blockchain technology and rollout pilot projects to test its viability The global initiative currently has 32 members and 25 organizations involved in the research and implementation of blockchain technology The Climate Chain Coalition and its membership charter On the 12th of December 2017 during the One Planet Summit a multistakeholder group of 25 organizations working on blockchain technology held a meeting and decided to establish a global initiative called the Climate Chain Coalition CCC The CCC’s mission is to “advance collaboration among members…to help enhance the environmental integrity and results of DLT distributed ledger technology applications for the climate” Massamba Thioye a member leading the UN Climate Change’s blockchain network agreed and stated that “the UN Climate Change secretariat recognizes the potential of blockchain technology to contribute to enhanced climate action and sustainability” Blockchain technology will therefore help mobilize climate finance to increase climate actions To move forward the CCC members agreed on shared principles and values to facilitate and guide activities for networking research governance demonstrations and pilot projects Using blockchain technology to tackle climate change Although the UN recently launched the CCC the UN had raised the idea of blockchain technology to tackle climate change in June 2017 The blog post mentioned that blockchain technology could be used to improve carbon emission trading facilitate clean energy trading enhance climate finance flows and improve tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas GHG emissions Alexandre Gellert Paris Associate Programme Officer at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC supported this statement as he mentioned that “blockchain could contribute to greater stakeholder involvement transparency and engagement and help bring trust and further innovative solutions in the fight against climate change leading to enhanced climate actions” Risks with blockchain technology The UN previously used the ethereum network to help Syrian refugees in 2017 so the CCC would not be the first use case of blockchain in the UN Further a press release in November 2017 announced that the UN had partnered with the World Identity Network WIN to develop a blockchain identity pilot aimed to help curb child trafficking However with any new technology and venture there are risks Thioye stated that “to fully and promptly mobilize this potential broad collaboration among stakeholders is needed to direct resources to priority areas avoid duplication of effort and avoid the pitfalls of working on a new technology with countless unknowns” There are currently 32 members in the Coalition The initiative remains open and welcomes new members that want to fight climate change Share your

Theresa May in China David Lidington Conservative MP for Aylesbury and Minster for the Cabinet Office heard her request at PMQs on Wednesday January 31 He responded by promising an audience with a minister over the matter Karen Lee said: “Lincoln’s WalkInCentre will close in a few weeks despite the fact that there is inconsistent and insufficient service provision in place to mitigate the closure” She requested that Lidington passed on a request to the Prime Minister to met with her to review the closure He said: “I’ll ensure a minister does see her about this” The Lincoln WalkInCentre on Monks Road will be open during weekends only throughout February and will close for good by the end of the month Lincolnshire West CCG the health group responsible for the service finalised the decision last week despite 94% of those surveyed rejecting the proposal Karen Lee previously said: “As a healthcare professional I understand that the delivery of health care changes and evolves with the passing of time However I am not supportive of the closure of the walkin centre because it is my belief that it’s closure is a downgrading of the health provision my constituents will be able to access “Further to that I am uncomfortable that the consultation process undertaken does not appear to have been a meaningful one given that 94% of respondents expressed the wish for the walkin centre to remain open and the voice of local people has been ignored “I am not confident that the assurances I have been given regarding an increase in GP appointments is sufficient either in number or frequency to replace the service currently provided by the walkin centre” No local organisations or elected bodies outside of the NHS supported the move during the consultation process Lincolnshire West CCG however promised that the closure would reduce the duplication of services and even enhance provisions for patients NHS chief claims services will be enhanced after Lincoln WalkInCentre

Government Brexit Analysis Says The UK Will Be Worse Off In Every Scenario Exclusive: BuzzFeed News has seen a new Brexit impact assessment which says leaving the EU will adversely hit almost every sector and every UK region Posted on Pin David Davis and Theresa May The governments new analysis of the impact of Brexit says the UK would be worse off outside the European Union under every scenario modelled BuzzFeed News can reveal The assessment which is titled “EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing” and dated January 2018 looked at three of the most plausible Brexit scenarios based on existing EU arrangements Under a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU UK growth would be 5% lower over the next 15 years compared to current forecasts according to the analysis The no deal scenario which would see the UK revert to World Trade Organization WTO rules would reduce growth by 8% over that period The softest Brexit option of continued singlemarket access through membership of the European Economic Area would in the longer term still lower growth by 2% These calculations do not take into account any shortterm hits to the economy from Brexit such as the cost of adjusting the economy to new customs arrangements Pin The cover title of the new analysis The assessment seen by BuzzFeed News is being kept tightly guarded inside government It was prepared by officials across Whitehall for the Department for Exiting the European Union DExEU and is reportedly being presented to key ministers in onetoone meetings this week ahead of discussion at the Brexit cabinet subcommittee next week Asked why the prime minister was not making the analysis public a DExEU source told BuzzFeed News: Because its embarrassing Even though the analysis assumes that the UK will agree a trade deal with the US roll over dozens of the EU’s current trade agreements and consider loosening regulations after Brexit there is no scenario that does not leave the country worse off Officials believe the methodology for the new assessment is better than that used for similar analyses before the referendum The January 2018 analysis looked only at existing EU arrangements which means bespoke arrangements have yet to be modelled Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she is seeking a deep and special partnership with the EU The other main findings of the analysis: • Almost every sector of the economy included in the analysis would be negatively impacted in all three scenarios with chemicals clothing manufacturing food and drink and cars and retail the hardest hit The analysis found that only the agriculture sector under the WTO scenario would not be adversely affected • Every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios with the North East the West Midlands and Northern Ireland before even considering the possibility of a hard border facing the biggest falls in economic performance • There is a risk that London’s status as a financial centre could be severely eroded with the possibilities available under an FTA not much different to those in the WTO option • On the plus side the analysis assumes in all scenarios that a trade deal with the US will be concluded and that it would benefit GDP by about 02% in the long term Trade deals with other nonEU countries and blocs such as China India Australia the Gulf countries and the nations of Southeast Asia would add in total a further 01% to 04% to GDP over the long term Pin Britains Secretary of State for Exiting the EU David Davis Theresa May European Commission

existence – or lack – of Brexit impact studies Last year the Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that dozens had been carried out “in excruciating detail” but after a Commons vote forced the publication of these assessments he told MPs he had been misunderstood and they did not exist after all DExEU published a series of broad sectoral analyses instead The biggest negative impact comes from the UK’s decision to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market – the issue at the heart of the Conservative Party’s ongoing internal strife over Brexit Leaving these arrangements creates what the analysis calls “nontariff barriers” to trade such as loss of market access in certain sectors and new customs and border checks and practices Some of these can be minimised if Britain were to remain in the single market via the EEA and the impact can also be partly offset through domestic policy or trade deals with the US and others but the losses cannot be eliminated altogether once the UK is outside the customs union This new analysis suggests that there could be opportunity for the UK in agreeing trade deals with nonEU countries and deregulating in areas such as the environment product standards and employment law However the analysis also casts doubt on the idea that these benefits would be enough to mitigate the losses to the economy caused by leaving the single market and customs union Moving away from the existing set of rules and standards would also make it harder to trade with the EU in the future and would be politically controversial domestically This specific debate risks deepening the conflict inside the Tory party between those such as chancellor Philip Hammond who want to remain more closely aligned to the EU for years and the hardline Brexiteers led by backbencher Jacob ReesMogg A government spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: “We have already set out that the government is undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis in support of our EU exit negotiations and preparations We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work and that ministers have a duty not to publish anything that could risk exposing our negotiation position” A government source said: “As part of its preparations for leaving the European Union officials from across Whitehall are undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis An early draft of this next stage of analysis has looked at different offtheshelf arrangements that currently exist as well as other external estimates It does not however set out or measure the details of our desired outcome – a new deep and special partnership with the EU – or predict the conclusions of the negotiations It also contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependent on a wide range of assumptions which demonstrate that significantly more work needs to be carried out to make use of this analysis and draw out conclusions” Alberto Nardelli is Europe editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in London Contact Alberto Nardelli at albertonardelli@buzzfeedcom Second Brexit analysis leak shows harm of tighter migration rules Leak comes after government decides to release leaked Brexit report to MPs Wed 31 Jan 2018 1823xa0EST First published on Wed 31 Jan 2018 0945xa0EST Share on Messenger Close The analysis showed the UK economy would be worse off under three key Brexit scenarios Photograph: Guy BellRexShutterstock The government is to release a leaked Brexit analysis that shows the UK economy would be significantly worse off in every modelled scenario after it decided not to oppose a Labour motion calling for the documents to be issued The decision came as a second leak from the analysis emerged showing that tightening up Britain’s immigration system after Brexit would cause more economic damage than could be balanced out by any trade gains The paper suggested the negative impact of a strict migration regime in which free movement was replaced with a policy similar to that for nonEU migrants would dwarf the 02% boost to economic growth from a US trade deal And the study suggested such growth would even be cancelled out under a more relaxed immigration regime according to the papers seen by BuzzFeed  The initial report on the leak revealed that it predicts the UK will end up economically worse off under three possible Brexit scenarios: a comprehensive free trade deal single market access and no deal at all Meanwhile a poll by the Best for Britain campaign group and YouGov showed shifting attitudes with the public now expressing a preference for free trade with the EU over immigration controls The shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the move to release the original analysis in full was “a victory for transparency and accountability” after the motion calling for the documents to be provided to MPs and the Brexit select committee was passed unanimously Asked by Starmer about when the papers would be released the Speaker John Bercow ruled it should happen “as a matter of urgency” as decreed in the motion After the debate Starmer said Labour expected ministers to hand over the papers by the end of the week though the exact timetable has yet to be determined Speaking in the debate the junior Brexit minister Robin Walker said some elements would be redacted if there was a possibility they could affect negotiations with the EU and the studies would only be available to MPs in a confidential reading room “A key part of this is for the government to be able to conduct internal thinking when it comes to preparing policy” Walker said The government has come under pressure to release the documents immediately and to the public with the crossparty Treasury committee of MPs writing to David Davis the Brexit secretary asking for this to happen “The document can hardly undermine the government’s negotiating position if it does not consider the government’s desired outcome” the committee’s chair Nicky Morgan wrote The climbdown came as Downing Street said Phillip Lee a junior justice minister had been reprimanded for tweeting that if such studies showed the economy would be harmed then a change in policy should follow No such action has been taken against the Brexit minister Steve Baker who said economic forecasts by government officials were “always wrong”  Ministers have dismissed the leaked analysis as interim and incomplete because it does not include the option of a bespoke deal with the EU which is being sought by the government but about which details have yet to be explained A Downing Street source said: “Phillip Lee will recognise that the analysis was initial and probably not worth commenting on He has been spoken to by the chief whip and reminded that it is best to air his view in private” Asked whether the lack of action against Baker meant the minister’s view was official government policy the source said: “I will stick with what Steve Baker said” TopicsPresident Donald J Trump Is Reshaping the Government Issued on: All News Quote For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust

Cabinet Files Were Found In  An Old Cabinet Facebook Enlarge this image Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls government is looking into how hundreds of secret documents were left inside two large cabinets that were sold Hes seen here with members of his Cabinet after they were sworn in in 2016 Rob GriffithAP hide caption toggle caption Rob GriffithAP Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls government is looking into how hundreds of secret documents were left inside two large cabinets that were sold Hes seen here with members of his Cabinet after they were sworn in in 2016 Rob GriffithAP Australias government is holding an urgent investigation into how hundreds of classified documents about the interior workings of several recent administrations found their way to the Australian Broadcasting Corp The ABC says the thousands of pages of documents had been left in two filing cabinets which the government then sold off at a secondhand shop The cabinets were bought cheap the network says because they were locked and the keys had been lost Inside the cabinets were records of five separate governments that spanned nearly 10 years some of them refer to current members of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls Cabinet The ABC began publishing parts of the files this week revealing the embarrassing inner workings of government — and today reporting that the trove of documents also include references to at least two other previously unknown breaches in which hundreds more secret and sensitive documents were either lost or left unsupervised Dubbing the documents the Cabinet Files  the network calls it one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history adding that the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing Among the revelations from the files: Former immigration minister Scott Morrison whos currently Turnbulls treasurer acted in late 2013 to limit the number of approved asylum seekers by arranging to delay security checks so that people close to being granted permanent protection would miss the deadline — a move that reportedly affected 30 asylum seekers each week Looking to cut spending under Prime Minister Tony Abbott his top treasury and finance officials considered denying welfare to anyone whos under 30 A range of scenarios were considered that targeted job snobs the ABC says but the plan was shelved over a potential backlash After controversial commentator Andrew Bolt was successfully accused of breaking the Racial Discrimination Act in 2011 the Cabinet later asked Bolt about changing the laws unreasonably restrictive reach — and was the only person specifically named as having been consulted the ABC says citing draft legislation that is part of the files Nearly 200 topsecret code word protected and sensitive documents were left in the office of senior minister Penny Wong when Labor lost the 2013 election the ABC says The materials dealt with topics ranging from details of counterterrorism operations to how to defend the United Arab Emirates from Iran Those documents were eventually found by security staff who saw them destroyed Nearly 400 national security files went missing from the Australian Federal Police over the course of five years from 20082013 The ABC says those classified records were from the powerful National Security Committee NSC of the cabinet which controls the countrys security intelligence and defense agenda The cabinet secretariats general practice was to give up searching and write off lost documents if they could not be found after repeated attempts When ABC began publishing some of the news from the documents this week it triggered speculation about a possible leak in the current government that Turnbull has led since 2015 But the network says there was no leak and that no one broke the law — instead someone finally got around to drilling out the locks on the two heavy cabinets that had been sold without any matching keys The documents were in two locked filing cabinets sold at an exgovernment sale in Canberra the ABC says A nifty person drilled the locks and uncovered the trove of documents inside The cabinets and their contents were bought for small change in a sale that could have been made to anyone the network says It adds The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade Nearly all the files are classified some as top secret or AUSTEO which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only The ABC isnt releasing any names or details about who bought the old informationrich cabinets or how it learned about them Citing confidential sources the network says it will protect their privacy at all costs After news of the massive security breach broke the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provided no more details releasing a statement saying only that its looking into the circumstances around the disposal of two Commonwealth Government filing cabinets that allegedly contained classified material Under Australian law the Cabinet records would have become public only after at least 20 years had passed But thanks to those other more common cabinets theyre being scrutinized nowDean Cheng Dean Cheng brings detailed knowledge of China’s military and space capabilities to bear as The Heritage Foundation’s research fellow on Chinese political and security affairs Read his research National security officials reportedly are considering federal funding and construction of a faster higher capacity nationwide wireless network to counter a similar effort by the Chinese government But expanding government interference in telecommunications would not advance national security or technological innovation According to Axioscom  a memo and PowerPoint presentation crafted by an unnamed senior official of the National Security Council urges the Trump administration to take “extraordinary efforts to counter the growing economic and political threat from China’s aggressive efforts to develop 5G” The term “5G” refers to fifthgeneration wireless broadband technology The service would expand wireless network capacity and increase transmission speeds—both of which could facilitate emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles and the growing demand for video services The National Security Council memo reportedly asserts that “China has achieved a dominant position in the manufacture and operation of network infrastructure” and “China is the dominant malicious actor in the Information Domain” Therefore the memo states the United States must build a nationwide 5G network within three years to counteract economic and cybersecurity threats from China The best way to do this the memo reportedly argues is for the government to build a network It would then rent access to carriers like AT&T Verizon and TMobile There is no national security risk from a 5G network in China The real threat to the US is the federal government’s failure to secure American telecommunications networks Those in the administration considering such a policy ought to abide the lessons of history That is government intervention in telecommunications has been a major factor for America trailing Asian and European nations in deployment of the most advanced wireless and broadband technologies Political and regulatory processes always trail the pace of technological change A government network protected from competition would also be immune from the financial pressures that drive private firms to innovate and maximize efficiency Moreover a governmentdesigned system directs resources into favored technologies which impedes both competition and innovation The federal government shouldn’t be set loose to seize private property to site a new network under the guise of national security The loss of property rights could arguably pose a greater longterm threat to liberty than China’s 5G network News of the National Security Council proposal met with swift opposition from Ajit Pai chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who wisely stated: I oppose any proposal for the federal government to build and operate a nationwide 5G network The main lesson to draw from the wireless sector’s development over the past three decades—including American leadership in 4G—is that the market not government is best positioned to drive innovation and investment “Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future” Pai added Telecom service providers have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars on developing 5G networks According to PCMagcom  Verizon plans to launch a 5G network in Sacramento California later this year The tremendous growth in demand for highspeed highvolume telecommunications services provides very strong incentive for network upgrades In response to news reports of the council memo a statement issued by AT&T Inc noted “Thanks to multibillion dollar investments made by American companies the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road … We have no doubt that America will lead the 5G revolution” There are steps the White House and Congress can take to facilitate new broadband infrastructure First the federal government should free up more spectrum for commercial use As researcher Brent Skorup noted “The largest challenge in wireless telecommunications policy is transferring spectrum from inefficient legacy operators such as the federal government to bandwidthhungry wireless broadband operators” In addition the government needs to improve its information security measures on the current system before it tries to lay claim to the next generation technology That the United States government did not stop incorporating antivirus software from Kaspersky a company with ties to the Russian intelligence system until this past year demonstrates how poorly it has secured the existing information environment To this end a reexamination of the role of Chinese companies in providing the information and communications equipment used throughout the US is long overdue Even a governmentrun system would have dubious security if its servers and routers were made in China Understanding the relationship between hardware companies such as Huawei and ZTE with the Chinese government is vital as these companies are striving to become key suppliers to various American telecommunications companies Whether the National Security Council memo is under serious consideration or just a trial balloon is unknown In either case President Donald Trump in keeping with his reform agenda should use every means at his disposal to unleash broadband innovation and investment through regulatory reform The White House also needs to examine the security of the existing network before expanding its interference in the market Allowing government to seize control of the next generation wireless network would be a huge mistake The

Close Capita runs London’s congestion charge scheme Photograph: Reuters More than £1bn was wiped off the stock market value of the government contractor Capita on Wednesday sparking fears of job losses and forcing Downing Street to play down the threat of a collapse echoing the demise of rival Carillion  Capita whose major contracts range from collecting the BBC licence fee to electronic tagging of prisoners saw its share price nearly halve in a day following a grim financial update that reignited concerns over the outsourcing industry and the stability of public services The prime minister’s spokesman insisted Capita was not in a similar position to Carillion  whose collapse earlier this month plunged thousands of workers and small businesses into uncertainty “Broadly we monitor the financial health of all our strategic suppliers including Capita and we are in regular discussions with them regarding their financial position” said Theresa May’s spokesman “And I would like to emphasise we do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers including Capita are in a comparable position to Carillion ” Capita’s shares plunged 475% cutting its stock market value by £11bn after new chief executive Jonathan Lewis stunned markets by admitting the company’s finances were in a dire state and announcing drastic measures to repair them Lewis appointed in October last year downgraded Capita’s profit forecasts and announced plans to raise £700m to shore up its balance sheet He also axed a dividend that had been worth more than £500m to investors over the past three years A costcutting programme is expected to result in job losses among Capita’s 67000 employees 50000 of whom are in the UK while parts of the business will be sold to raise cash Within 10 hours of its statement to the City Capita’s stock market value had fallen to £12bn with a £381m pension deficit and debts predicted to hit £115bn by the end of the year Lewis said the company which has grown rapidly through a string of acquisitions had become “too complex” and admitted the firm was lacking in discipline Q&A Show Hide Capita was founded in 1984 when exlocal government officer Rod Aldridge led a management buyout of the business from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy At the time it had 33 employees The company joined the stock market in 1991 and became a member of the FTSE 100 in 2006 In the same year Aldridge resigned as executive chairman after it was revealed he had lent the Labour party £1m He denied suggestions the loan had any influence on the company winning government contracts but said he would step down to avoid any further controversy He was replaced by Paul Pindar who became one of Britain’s best paid businessmen earning £25m in 2012 He stepped down from the group in 2014 to move into private equity Capita grew largely through acquisitions but a series of profit warnings saw it lose its place in the FTSE 100 in March 2017 • Employees: 67000 About 50000 based in the UK • Revenue 2016: £49bn • Proportion of business in public sector: 47% • Dividend payout 2016: £210m • Net debt expected at end of 2017: £115bn • Pension deficit: £381m • Share price peak: £1326 July 2015 • Share price now: 196p • Market capitalisation at peak: £88bn • Market capitalisation now: £13bn Was this helpful Thank you for your feedback The measures announced by Lewis are likely to be interpreted as preemptive action to ensure a profitable future at a challenging time for the outsourcing industry signalled by Carillion’s collapse  The outsourcing model involves the government farming out public sector work to private companies Like Carillion Capita counts the UK government among its major clients with contracts that include running London’s congestion charge scheme tagging prisoners operating a jobseeker’s allowance telephone line and administering the teachers’ pension scheme It also collects the licence fee for the BBC Labour said the government should take steps to oversee the activities of Capita “The Tories’ privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis threatening jobs taxpayers’ money and leaving people without the services they need” said Jon Trickett the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office “The government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first” Frank Field chair of the work and pensions committee said it would be looking into Capita In a statement that referred to the accounting group that signed off Carillion’s figures KPMG he said: “Another day another outsourcing firm with massive debt a huge pension deficit a KPMG audit and the big four popping up at every turn in the company’s chequered history “Sadly Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners’ rights” Carillions collapse should make all councils rethink privatisation | Joanne Fry Read more Some City analysts said Capita still had plenty of time to avoid the fate of Carillion David Madden an analyst at City firm CMC Markets said the action from Capita was “a red alert” for investors but added that it “could turn itself around” “Carillion collapsed but Capita is still in the game” Madden said Frances O’Grady  the general secretary of trade union body the TUC said the profit warning from Capita was “really worrying” and urged the government to act “We can’t afford another Carillion The TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms It’s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts inhouse if they are at risk” Lewis said the measures announced on Wednesday were the “first steps in the road to recovery” predicting his turnaround would take two years Q&A What government contracts does Capita hold Show

recognize there are still people that might not have gotten those resources” The relief operation has come under fire for groundlevel failures to provide relief and for its overall approach to the effort In a number of interviews Lt Gen Russel L Honoré who is widely credited with turning around the Bush administration’s sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina has said the Trump administration has underutilized the military exacerbating the slow delivery of aid and the removal of debris General Honoré said that by this point he would have moved 50000 troops to Puerto Rico But some disaster experts say that while the military can be useful it is not a cureall in relief efforts and that too many troops could overwhelm available resources in Puerto Rico Others note the demands of addressing three major hurricanes in a row The Trump administration has put an Army general in charge of recovery efforts and several thousand additional troops will soon be sent to the island Photo Shelves at a grocery store in Comerío PR on Sunday Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday government officials said they were making progress in aid efforts Alejandro De La Campa the coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Puerto Rico said officials so far have installed 22 generators primarily at highpriority facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes The Army Corps of Engineers is deciding where to install 100 additional generators and another 300 are en route to the island Officials said about $28 million had been approved for local municipalities for debris removal and other services Still Mr De La Campa said recovery efforts in the interior of the island continue to lag because many of the roads remain inaccessible “We are currently developing a strategy to reach the center of the island” he said FEMA officials said they did not encounter the same issues distributing supplies to residents after the hurricanes in Texas and in Florida because despite the damage most roads into those areas remained intact Once the floodwaters receded they were able to deliver aid Advertisement “With Maria you had a number of roads that were completely washed out and bridges that were impacted” said Will Booher a spokesman for FEMA “That’s what’s made it much more challenging” Photo The contents of a food box from FEMA Credit Erika P Rodriguez for The New York Times Compounding the problems some cities in Puerto Rico did not have enough trucks to haul their supplies home if they had any available at all leaving one city to borrow transportation from another “Some of them had to leave maybe a pallet behind because they couldn’t fit” said Capt Amado Zudaire of the Puerto Rico State Guard the commander of the regional staging area in the northeast city of Cánovanas “The more we give them the tougher it gets on them to deliver” But large enclosed trucks that belong to the Puerto Rico Department of Education were seen sitting unused at the staging area in Cánovanas on Monday Puerto Rican and federal officials said they had been pushing out the approximately five million meals and five million liters of water that had been delivered to the island of 34 million people largely through an expanding network of 11 regional aid centers set up by the governor But some local officials said they needed assistance commensurate with their populations — more than the three pallets of food and one pallet of water allotted per day “I received 10000 meals so far and we’re a city of 54000” Lornna Soto the mayor of Cánovanas said on Monday “We need more water We need more food” Photo Food water and basic supplies are getting to the island but distributing it remains a challenge Credit Erika P Rodriguez for The New York Times Ms Soto stood with a megaphone in front of the public library where an ad hoc distribution point had formed The Red Cross was handing out fresh fruit and city workers were giving out boxes of water and food from FEMA “There’s no more water!” Ms Soto told the people waiting in line Families walked away with one or two meals and the lucky ones also got 24 bottles of water Aida Nieves 63 received two meals to feed the eight people in her household Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Well at least the water arrived — that’s a first” Ms Nieves said as she pushed her cart “That’s for today I guess tomorrow we have to come back The people here were waiting and it was not coming We were so desperate” Other families said it was unfair that there was no clear process for receiving food The deliveries were left to luck and chance Those who happened to be standing nearby when the food came received it Though Mr Rosselló said on Tuesday that the federal government had denied a request to allow hurricane victims in Puerto Rico to use food stamps at fastfood restaurants and other places that serve prepared hot meals officials at the Department of Agriculture which oversees the federal nutrition program said they sent a letter to Puerto Rico on Sept 30 approving a waiver that would allow foodstamp recipients to use their benefits to buy hot food The agency granted similar waivers following hurricanes in Texas and Florida Photo Outside the shelter in Comerío where several families remain two weeks after the storm

hillside that she wanted to know one simple thing when visitors approached her front door on Monday: “Que hora es” What time is it Like everyone else in the municipality she has no running water so she relies on whatever flows down from the mountains through a makeshift network of tubes and tanks It is usually just a trickle she said so she has been taking sponge baths and relying on her soninlaw to bring in bottled water She said she had heart problems and her left arm hung limp from a stroke all of which compounded her concern about the damaged roads and lack of communication “I can’t scream because there’s no one here” she said “If I have an emergency I’ll die” In the mountains the scale of natural devastation continues to hamper delivery efforts In Las Marías the storm clogged so many roads and toppled so many trees that it took volunteers and work crews about a week of sawing through fallen tree trunks and bulldozing mudslides to clear a path local officials said But keeping those supply lines open is a Sisyphean task “When it rains for 10 15 minutes everything we’ve cleared slides and we have to clear it again” said Wilver Morales 43 who works for the

Continue reading the main story That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants The partnership brings together Amazon the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries Berkshire Hathaway the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E Buffett and JPMorgan Chase the largest bank in the United States by assets Photo From left: Warren E Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase Credit Associated Press They are moving into an industry where the lines between traditionally distinct areas such as pharmacies insurers and providers are increasingly blurry CVS Health’s deal last month to buy the health insurer Aetna for about $69 billion is just one example of the changes underway Separately Amazon’s potential entry into the pharmacy business continues to rattle major drug companies and distributors Here’s a look at how even the threat of Amazon’s entry into an industry can rattle stocks The companies said the initiative which is in its early stages would be “free from profitmaking incentives and constraints” but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released Jamie Dimon the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans “The health care system is complex and we enter into this challenge openeyed about the degree of difficulty” Jeff Bezos Amazon’s founder and chief executive said in a statement  “Hard as it might be reducing health care’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort” The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do especially given Amazon’s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans — from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television It follows speculation that the company which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics We asked health care experts to imagine what the three corporations might do “It could be big” Ed Kaplan who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group said of the announcement “Those are three big players and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space they are going to make a big impact” Taking On ‘the Hungry Tapeworm’ A look at the three companies that announced a joint health care initiative on Tuesday But others were less sure noting that the three companies — which combined employ more than one million people — might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system” said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors “The idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch” Even the three companies don’t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care People briefed on the plan who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr Bezos Mr Buffett and Mr Dimon who are friends discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency — whatever it might turn out to be “The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy” Mr Buffett said in the statement “Our group does not come to this problem with answers But we also do not accept it as inevitable” Over the past several months the three had met formally — along with Todd Combs an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan’s board — to discuss the idea according to a person familiar with Mr Buffett’s thinking Premiums Are Rising Faster Than Earnings and Inflation %

Damon Root | Jan 25 2018 9:35 am Phartisan  DreamstimeFederal authorities arrested Joseph Tigano III in 2008 and charged him with running a marijuanagrowing operation Tigano entered a plea of not guilty and insisted that his case move quickly to trial Instead he languished in pretrial detention—jail—for nearly seven years before he finally appeared before a jury which convicted him in 2015 In an opinion issued this week the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit dismissed Tiganos indictment with prejudice on the grounds that his oppressive period of pretrial incarceration violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment The criminal justice systems treatment of Tigano is appalling During his nearly sevenyear pretrial incarceration Tigano loudly and repeatedly invoked his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial Because Tigano kept bringing up the Sixth Amendment he was forced to undergo three separate courtordered examinations to determine whether he was competent to be tried According to one of the prosecutors involved in the case Mr Tigano III had been sort of demanding his speedy trial which is part of the prompting for the Court sending him out for this evaluation Tigano passed all three exams with flying colors The 2nd Circuit was correct to toss out Tiganos conviction The framers and ratifiers of the Constitution viewed trial by jury as a fundamental right Article III Section 2 of the Constitution says the Trial of all Crimes except in cases of Impeachment shall be by Jury and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed Because that language was not strong enough to satisfy the AntiFederalists the Sixth Amendment was added to the Constitution as an extra safeguard in 1791 In all criminal prosecutions it reads the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed In a 1789 letter to Thomas Paine Thomas Jefferson expressed the opinion of many in the founding generation when he praised the right to trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution It was this bedrock constitutional right that Joseph Tigano III invoked again and again during his pretrial incarceration And it was because Tigano kept invoking this right that he was made to suffer the punishment—there is no other word for it—of being left to rot in a cell without trial for 6 years 9 months and 26 days As the 2nd Circuit observed Tiganos detention appears to be the longest ever experienced by a defendant in a speedy trial case in the Second Circuit If that doesnt violate the Sixth Amendment what does Tiganos ordeal illuminates a much bigger problem Consider what Assistant US Attorney Thomas Duszkiewicz had to say about the third competency examination that Tigano was forced to undergo It was sparked not necessarily by the competency question Duszkiewicz said but by whether there is some other psychological problem thats going to prevent Tigano from understanding the difference between what he potentially looks at as far as a conviction as well as whats being offered by way of this plea Translation: Federal prosecutors piled on the charges expecting Tigano to plead guilty to a lesser offense and save everybody the trouble of going to trial The prosecutors also let it be known that if Tigano rejected their deal they would throw the book at him and he would forfeit his shot at whats being offered by way of this plea In short sacrifice your Sixth Amendment rights and youll do less time That coercive approach is standard operating procedure among prosecutors in criminal cases According to the Justice Department 97 percent of federal criminal convictions result from guilty pleas At the state level the figure is roughly 94 percent In other words only a tiny number of criminal suspects ever go to trial For all practical purposes the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed has been largely abolished The criminal justice system has become almost exclusively a system of plea bargaining negotiated behind closed doors and with no judicial oversight Judge Jed S Rakoff wrote in 2014 The outcome is very largely determined by the prosecutor alone Rakoffs description of the phenomenom is worth quoting at length: What really puts the prosecutor in the drivers seat is the fact that he—because of mandatory minimums sentencing guidelines which though no longer mandatory in the federal system are still widely followed by most judges and simply his ability to shape whatever charges are brought—can effectively dictate the sentence by how he publicly describes the offense For example the prosecutor can agree with the defense counsel in a federal narcotics case that if there is a plea bargain the defendant will only have to plead guilty to the personal sale of a few ounces of heroin which carries no mandatory minimum and a guidelines range of less than two years but if the defendant does not plead guilty he will be charged with the drug conspiracy of which his sale was a small part a conspiracy involving many kilograms of heroin which could mean a tenyear mandatory minimum and a guidelines range of twenty years or more Put another way it is the prosecutor not the judge who effectively exercises the sentencing power albeit cloaked as a charging decision Now recall the words of Assistant US Attorney Duszkiewicz in the Tigano case He said the judge ordered the third competency exam to make sure that Tigano understood the difference between what he potentially looks at as far as a conviction as well as whats being offered by way of this plea Put more bluntly: In a system that has gutted the right to trial by jury and given vast and virtually unaccountable power to prosecutors only the crazy would dare to exercise their Sixth Amendment rights Damon Root is a senior editor of Reason magazine and the author of Overruled: The Long

Early Word on a Contract May Have Helped Investors Cash In Sounds dodgy but there may not be anything illegal about that By More stories by Shahien Nasiripour Illustration: 731 On Jan 11 a group of 42 debt collection agencies awaited word on which ones had wonxa0contracts from the US Department of Education The federal government has been the main lender to student borrowers since 2010 and the deal to collect on unpaid student loansxa0could be worth hundreds of millions of dollarsxa0 Shortly after 1:30 pm an Education Department employee sent emails to 40 of the companies to let them know they weren’t among them The agency publicly announced the winners in a court filing at 3:47 pm During the time in between investors bought up shares of one of the winning bidders Performant Financial Corp  a Livermore Califxa0company that once had financial ties to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos The company’s stock jumped almost 20 percent from the time the department started notifying bidders about the contract to when the news was made publicxa0 Fewer than 900 of Performant’s 51 million shares had traded during the first four hours of that day Bloomberg data show By 2 pm the company’s stock was in high demand Over the next minute and 11 seconds some 37000 shares traded hands seven times more than the previous two days combined An additional 142000 shares would trade before the government announced that Performant had won the contractxa0 The investors couldn’t be identified The other winning bidder Windham Professionals Inc  is privately held Ifxa0undertheradar government information was being traded on for profit it wouldn’t be the first timexa0Over the past two years executives at two hedge funds have pleaded guiltyxa0to trading on informationxa0from government insiders relating to healthcare companies In a separate incident in August a series of trades was made in shares of student loan giant Navient Corp just before the Education Department made public the news that it would no longer provide student loan data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which isxa0 suing Navient xa0for allegedly causing some borrowers to overpay Navientxa0is contesting the suit and denies wrongdoing The AFLCIO and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren a Democrat asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the trades  Navientxa0has said the company welcomes any investigation into trading of the stock and that it didn’t know about the Education Department’s move until it was made publicxa0 Investors who purchased Performant’s shares probably didn’t violate any insider trading laws—as long as they weren’t illicitly tipped off by Education Department employees or employed by Performant experts say In its email to the losing bidders the department identified the two winning firms but didn’t mandate that the information remain confidential “If you have information that you know is nonpublic and material but you have no duty to keep quiet it’s in the category of information you overhear in a taxi” saysxa0Stephen Crimmins a former SEC enforcement lawyer who now works for Murphy & McGonigle “You can trade on it” John Coffee a professor of corporate law at Columbia University who’s advised members of Congress on insider trading questioned why the Education Department didn’t wait to notify bidders until after the trading day ended “It’s quite clumsy and negligent but I don’t think it’s criminal” he says David Bergeron who retired from the department in 2013 as head of postsecondary education saysxa0his bosses stressed the need to be guarded about matters that could affect publicly traded companies “It’s extraordinarily troubling” Bergeron saysxa0of the Performant trades Chris Greene a department spokesman says the government complied with federal rules in communicating its contracting decision He didn’t respond to other questions Lisa Im Performant’s chief executive officer says no one at her company purchased shares that day in advance of the court filing She saysxa0three people at Performant including her knew about the contract awardxa0and it wasn’t announced internally and to investors until the next morningxa0She exercised options the day of the contract award to dispose of stock worth $23683 but the filing lists the transaction as being part of a scheduled trading plan set in August The options were exercised because they’re due to expire this month Imxa0saysxa0“We definitely saw it moving” she saysxa0about the company’s share price in the hours before the Education Department made the contract award public “But at that point until we press release something we don’t let anyone know” Performant has ties to DeVos The education secretary was an investor in a fund that owned a portion of a $148 million loan made to Performant in 2012 she said she’d divest shortly after becoming secretary The loan was paid off in Augustxa0In addition a former DeVos adviser atxa0the Education Department Taylor Hansen is the son of a Performant board member William Hansen a top Education Department official in the George W Bush administration “I’m sure the company handled everything appropriately as did the department” says William Hansen US student debt totals $15 trillion and more than 92 percent of that is either backed or owned by the federal government records showxa0 The Education Department’s debt collection and loan servicing contracts pay almost $2 billion in annual commissionsxa0and competition for the work is fierce Performant had been a student loan collector for the Education Department for more than 20 years before its contract expired in April 2015 according to regulatory filings The agency picked new debt collection firms in December 2016 but several losing bidders including Performant sued the department to overturn its decision The cases dragged on for a yearxa0until a federal court judge ordered the department to wrap it up by Jan 11 On that day Mark Benson an Education Department employee based in Atlanta started to notify each of the 42 bidders for the contract of the government’s decision according to copies of his correspondence His emails went out starting around 1:35 pm Benson declined to comment At 3:47 pm in Washington lawyers for the Department of Justice told the judge in a court filing that the Education Department had complied with his order and that Performant and Windham Professionals had won the contract The document filed electronically was instantaneously available to anyone checking the docket The award valued at as much as $400 million was a big deal for Performant which had lost money for more than two years The company warned investors in November that failing to win the contract would have a “material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in 2018 and beyond”xa0That evening Michael Tarkan an analyst who follows Performant at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC upgraded the company’s

Economy Budget to test investors faith in Modis government Markets will be focused on how much India widens its fiscal deficit beyond the 3 percent of gross domestic product projected for 201819 Reuters| Updated: Jan 31 2018 17:03 PM IST Comments | Mumbai: Since his election four years ago Indian markets have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi`s campaign to mend patchy public finances and develop new areas of growth in Asia`s third largest economy To keep investors` confidence however Modi`s government will need to be seen containing the fiscal deficit while also increasing spending in key areas of the slowing economy Markets will be focused on how much India widens its fiscal deficit beyond the 3 percent of gross domestic product projected for 201819 A Reuters poll showed most economists expect a 32 percent deficit as the government looks to increase investments in key areas such as agriculture to bolster its reelection prospects in elections due by 2019 A modest widening of that nature would calm investors worried that the government may slip away from its judicious spending Traders say bond yields could fall 10 to 15 basis points while shares could hit new record highs Gains could be more pronounced if India sticks to its 30 percent target But a deficit above 32 percent could hit shares and send bond yields up by 2025 basis points depending on the size of the blowout on fears of populist policy ahead of next year`s elections Markets remain nervous after the government`s annual economic survey on Monday suggested a pause in fiscal consolidation sending bonds plummeting I think the budget will be focused on both investors as well as the common man said A Balasubramanian chief executive officer at Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management adding he expects a deficit of 32 percent The government will take care so that the budget is neither inflationary nor fiscally less prudent A prudent budget could also soothe the Reserve Bank of India which holds a policy review on Feb 67 amid worries it could raise rates in coming months after inflation hit a 17month high in December well above its 4 percent target CRITICAL JUNCTURE Benchmark 10year bond yields have fallen 135 bps and the NSE share index has surged 55 percent since Modi took power in May 2014 But a recent spike in inflation tightening cash conditions and worries about fiscal slippage have sent the 10year bond yield up more than 80 basis points since July the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis Stocks have been more resilient gaining 49 percent this year and hitting records amid signs earnings are recovering after years of poor performance While investors expect some spending to support an economy that`s expected to post its weakest growth in four years they will want to see such stimulus is wellfinanced Growth has been hampered by a chaotic rollout of a goods and service tax last year and a shock move to ban high value currency notes in late 2016 which hit tax revenues and increased the chances the fiscal deficit shortfall would hit 32 percent target for the year to March An expected pickup in growth next fiscal year and state asset sales estimated to raise 1 trillion rupees $1574 billion should boost tax revenues Despite an expected revenue increase investors don`t believe India will swing to profligacy with a rally in oil prices likely to constrain government spending India imports 80 percent of its energy requirements and the government may need to respond to higher crude prices like it did in October by cutting fuel duties The risk that such a contingency is needed could keep the government in check I believe that there is a high chance that fiscal discipline is more likely to be maintained in this budget said Lakshmi Iyer fixed income head at Kotak Mutual Fund Tags:

documents from the Australian government ended up being sold at a secondhand shop prompting government officials Wednesday to launch an investigation into how the highly sensitive documents were

EMAIL UPROXXShutterstock Apple isn’t having the best 2018 between the relative struggles of the iPhone X and the rising confusion and anger over reports it deliberately slowed down older phones to spare their aging batteries The battery issue is far from over too as it appears that the federal government is getting involved Bloomberg first reported that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Apple’s slowdown something Apple confirmed with Axios The question isn’t whether or not Apple deliberately slowed down their phones: Apple has admitted that’s exactly what happened  The question is about what Apple’s motives were in doing so On the one side you have Apple who claims the code uncovered by independent researchers was a fix implemented to end older iPhones spontaneously shutting down Apple claims that as new versions of iOS arrive they’re more energy hungry draining the battery faster and befuddling older batteries On the other you have the longtime claim that Apple deliberately slows down older phones to force you to upgrade a form of planned obsolescence that artificially inflates the company’s bottom line It’s a theory aggravated in part by Apple’s ongoing tendency to glue phones together and otherwise make them difficult to fix at home although Apple fans counter that the company’s taste for closed architecture has made their products difficult to get into and repair for decades So part of the complaint here isn’t new As to which side is right well that’ll be a matter of investigation And now that the government is involved we might get a definitive answer

Eyes on 2019 polls government plans over 60 media units to expand outreach By Jan 31 2018 1243 AM IST 0Comments I&B minister Smriti Irani has spoken to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das among others to allot space for the proposed media units officials said NEW DELHI: The information and broadcasting ministry plans to set up more than 60 media units across the country that are expected to strengthen the Modi government’s outreach to smaller cities and rural areas in the runup to the 2019 general election This is the first time the ministry is planning to set up media units beyond the capital cities officials said pointing to Bhuj Rohtak Siliguri Kochi Korba and Muzaffarnagar among other places which they said minister Smriti Irani has identified for strengthening the government’s communication machinery The new media units are likely to become operational in the next few months well in time for the next general election said one of the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity These units are expected to run a structured eightmonth campaign to highlight the Modi government’s achievements the official said such as its efforts to finetune the goods and services tax or GST regime tackle nonperforming assets of banks quicken the pace of electrification complete infrastructure projects weed out corruption in high places and ensure direct benefit transfer of subsidies Irani has spoken to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das among others to allot space for the proposed media units officials said In UP alone seven media units are likely to come up in places including Bareilly Moradabad Aligarh Agra Muzaffarnagar and the PM’s constituency Varanasi besides state capital Lucknow States including Tamil Nadu Maharashtra Rajasthan MP Bihar and Karnataka will have two centres each for the Centre’s media units as per the plan while nine centres will come up in states in the Northeast The I&B ministry has already allocated funds to make the proposed media units operational officials said In each of the new media units they said there will be an electronic media monitoring centre which will look at the content in local newspapers and TV channels and send updates to the head office in Delhi The ministry also plans to set up a social media communication hub in every state across the country that will report local events to ministry officials Seven senior officers of director general level will be stationed in Chandigarh Lucknow Kolkata Bhopal Mumbai Chennai and Imphal to monitor flow of information in their respective zones as per the plan The emphasis will be on flow of communication in regional languages which will now include apart from Hindi and Urdu in northern states Dogri Garhwali Santhali Bhojpuri Maithali and Konkani officials said Seven senior officers who were handling mediarelated work in the capital for ministries have been chosen to head the new media units and oversee dissemination of the governments communication to the remotest areas This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mandate to “not just have governance in place but also keep the citizens informed about its policies” the official cited earlier said Several other officials posted in the capital and existing media units of the government in other cities have been transferred to other parts of the country in the past two months The I&B ministry saw the transfer of 20 IIS Indian Information Service officers last month after two dozen officers were transferred in the previous month and many more are expected to be relocated in the coming days Irani wants to break the “stagnancy” in media units across the country another official said although the main purpose behind the transfers is said to be the merging of several existing departments of the media units to “streamline and disseminate information” “The minister has noticed that fresh energy needs to be infused into these units so that existing cliques of people working against the government or stalling communication can be checked” the official said “A fresh map was drawn where she identified the places that need stronger communication in the coming days and then selected people accordingly to handle the new tasks” Under the new system according to the plan put together by Irani and I&B secretary NK Sinha the Press Information Bureau will not only handle all issues of communication but also those related to the Registrar of Newspapers for India Cable Television Network and the monitoring by Electronic Media Monitoring Centres The Directorate of Field Publicity will also handle issues related to the Directorate of Advertising and Publicity and the Publications Division “Heads of newspapers will no longer have to travel to Delhi to get their issues sorted They can go to the district offices” an official said I&B ministry officials have dismissed complaints of a section of IIS officers who alleged that transfers were taking place without any consultation and that some senior officers were transferred to stations where the posts allotted to them did not exist or that multiple officers were assigned the same role Officials said five meetings were held with officers involved in government communication to know their location preferences Irani was keen that government officials who have been posted in the Northeast or other farflung areas also get a choice of location a person aware of the matter said “Some people don’t want to leave Delhi while several others have never been posted in cities The minister felt that should end At least five cases where the person was close to retirement or cases where the officer was unwell or had a child with dyslexia were looked at and the transfers were stopped” the person said on condition of anonymity Suitability has been the key governing principle behind the transfers the person said “If a certain officer has had years of experience working in the RAW and home ministry he was seen as most suited to handle the Northeastern states where internal security is a grave concern In another case an officer from Election Commission has also been asked to handle finance as he already had experience in the area in his earlier years” he said 0Comments

Famous Quote Government Shouldn’t Play a Part in Everyday Life “Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business Government shouldn’t play a part in everyday life Jefferson said that the people should be left to manage their own affairs His opposition will bear careful analysis and the country could stand a good deal more of its application The trouble with us is we talk about jefferson but we do not follow him In this theory that the people should manage their government and not be managed by it he was everlastingly right” –Calvin Coolidge

Financial Post Millions in foreign funds spent in 2015 federal election to defeat Harper government report alleges In total 114 third parties poured $6 million into influencing the election outcome and many of those third parties were funded by the USbased Tides Foundation Calgary Centre MP Joan Crockatt is introduced in the House of Commons by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on December 12 2012 LinkedIn Foreign money funnelled towards Canadian political advocacy groups affected the outcome of the 2015 federal election according to a document filed last week with Elections Canada and obtained in part by the Calgary Herald The 36page report entitled: Elections Canada Complaint Regarding Foreign Influence in the 2015 Canadian Election alleges third parties worked with each other which may have bypassed election spending limits — all of which appears to be in contravention of the Canada Elections Act The Canada Elections Act states that “a third party shall not circumvent or attempt to circumvent a limit set out    in any manner including by splitting itself into two or more third parties for the purpose of circumventing the limit or acting in collusion with another third party so that their combined election advertising expenses exceed the limit” “Electoral outcomes were influenced” alleges the report The Canada Elections Act also states: “No person who does not reside in Canada shall during an election period in any way induce electors to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate” unless the person is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident THE CANADIAN PRESSFred Chartrand “Yet the outcome of the 2015 election was skewed by money from wealthy foreigners” alleges the complaint submitted by Canada Decides a registered society with three listed directors — including Joan Crockatt a former Conservative MP for Calgary Centre who lost her seat to Liberal Kent Hehr now the MP for the once longheld Tory riding and the Minister of Veterans Affairs The other two directors include Chad Hallman a University of Toronto political science student The number of third parties registered during the 2015 general election more than doubled to 114 compared with 55 in the 2011 election Americans are rightly concerned about Russia hacking into US government emails Well this appears to be much worse In total the 114 third parties spent $6 million and many of those third parties were funded by Californiaand New Yorkbased Tides Foundation — which is known in Canada for holding numerous antiCanadian oil campaigns In 2015 Tides Foundation donated $15 million of US money to Canadian third parties in the election year according to the report Crockatt’s seat was one of the 29 targeted by an organization called Leadnow through its “largest ever campaign” called Vote Together The complaint by Canada Decides alleges that foreign money “spawned” Leadnow and helped fund an elaborate campaign to oust the ruling Conservative Party PATRICK BRENNAN  Postmedia News Mount Royal University political science professor Duane Bratt says Canadians should be concerned about any kind of foreign involvement in our elections “The whole concept and idea of foreign influence in an election is an important issue and is something that Canadians should not tolerate” Bratt said Monday Tides Foundation and Leadnow representatives did not return repeated phone calls and emails from the Herald to respond to concerns raised by Canada Decides A December 2015 Leadnow report Defeating Harper discusses how effective its campaign was in the 2015 general election “The Conservatives were defeated in 25 out of 29 ridings and    in the seats the Conservatives lost our recommended candidate was the winner 96 per cent of the time” Leadnow’s Defeat Harper report also states: “We selected target ridings with field teams run by paid Leadnow organizers…” Crockatt lost her Calgary Centre seat by 750 votes Conservative MP Lawrence Toet lost his Manitoba seat of ElmwoodTranscona to the NDP’s Daniel Blaikie by just 61 votes THE CANADIAN PRESS  Adrian Wyld Former Conservative Finance Minister Joe Oliver lost his seat to Liberal Marco Mendicino with a margin of 5800 votes Only six per cent of voters in that riding voted for the NDP candidate who complained of Leadnow’s tactics on Twitter Leadnow staff members flew around the country on numerous occasions as Facebook postings and photographs show to distribute flyers and put up signs Also 57 local polls were commissioned across 37 ridings urging citizens to strategically vote for the most winnable leftofcentre candidate in order to defeat the Conservative candidate There is an $8788 spending limit per riding for the election NDP candidates and even CUPE complained about Leadnow’s activities being antidemocratic “This is not a partisan issue or a case of sour grapes by Conservatives” insists Hallman 20 “This is a Canadian issue This affects all Canadians whether you’re an NDP Green Liberal or Conservative You should be very concerned about foreign money being spent in Canada during an election campaign” Most Canadians would be very alarmed by this This happened in the 2015 election Crockatt who prior to becoming a Member of Parliament was a journalist including a stint as an editor with the Calgary Herald said researchers from Fredericton to Nanaimo worked for 18 months gathering information on this issue “Foreign money meddled in a big way in our election and that’s not right” she added “Americans are rightly concerned about Russia hacking into US government emails Well this appears to be much worse — foreign money in many cases by very wealthy people — was donated and arguably changed the outcome of our Canadian election It needs to be taken seriously and investigated” In the 2015 annual report of the Californiabased Online Progressive Engagement Network OPEN where Ben Brandzel one of Leadnow’s founders currently works he said: “We ended the year with    a Canadian campaign that moved the needle during the national election contributing greatly to the ousting of the conservative Harper government” Just how greatly these foreign organizations and money contributed to interfering in the Canadian election needs to be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada states Canada Decides “The threat to Canadian election sovereignty is real and must be eliminated by the Commissioner as quickly and decisively as possible” adds the report Rod MacIvor Postmedia News files It appears as though Yves Cote commissioner of Elections Canada is considering doing just that Cote admitted during an April 13 Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that an investigation needs to be launched following questions by Conservative Senators Linda Frum and Bob Runciman “Issues of significance have been raised   ” said Cote during the senate committee hearing “which in my view deserves Parliament taking the time to looking at the situation trying to understand what has happened what is likely to happen and then taking measures    to make sure there is compliance” Cote added that “the Supreme Court of Canada said the objective of maintaining a level playing field is for them a very important objective” Senator Frum is planning to introduce a private member’s bill updating the Canada Elections Act to prohibit third parties from accepting foreign funding for domestic political activity Canadians can only donate $1550 to political parties and candidates Union and corporate donations have been banned completely and yet in the Senate hearing Commissioner Cote said that as long as foreign money is donated to a third party six months prior to the election writ being dropped the amount that can be donated is endless Frum made the following observation during the April 13 senate hearing: “I could take a cheque for $10 million from Saudi Arabia from Iran from China — I could take any amount of money from a foreign contributor so long as I a Canadian citizen am receiving it” Cote said as long as funds are received six months before an election “the third party is free to use that money” “Most Canadians would be very alarmed by this” added Frum “This happened in the 2015 election” News Videos

Former finance minister Boima Kamara By Lennart Dodoo Monrovia — From all indications President George Manneh Weahs administration is poised to face a rough beginning in the face of a deteriorating economy compounded by a looming budget shortfall and the lowest foreign reserves in the last five years According to the Central Bank of Liberia the current foreign reserve Weahs administration has inherited is US$1551 million And with the prevailing economic situation generating more revenue would be a daunting task that would require massive stimulus plan The President is not ignorant of what he has signed up to In his maiden Annual Message at Legislature on Monday 29 January 2018 right in the presence of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Weah said the obvious:  It is possible to inform you that the state of the economy that my administration has inherited leaves a lot to be desired This is plain for all to see for we are all affected by it Our economy is broken our government is broke our currency is in freefall inflation is rising unemployment is at an unprecedented high and our foreign reserves are at an alltime low According to the Central Bank of Liberia CBL the country in 2017 experienced sharp increase in inflation from 88 percent in 2016 to 124 percent Exchange rate pressure rise in global petroleum price coupled with governments tax policy on petroleum products were major factors leading to the high inflation However the country experienced some growth in the GDP last year There was an increase of 25 percent bringing the GDP up to US$9043 million T he improvement in the GDP according to the CBL can be attributed in the increase in the mining of gold in the country Weah told the Legislature that he was informed by the transitional team that total revenue collected in calendar year 2017 amounted to US$4891 million which is 13 percent decline over revenue collected in 2016 which was US$5651 million But the President isnt confident of the figures and did say he would not vouch for them in the absence of the complete audit Finance Ministry sources informed FrontPageAfrica that the Liberia Revenue Authority may likely not be able to raise up to US$60 million of the FY201718 National Budget due to several variables ranging from issues with imports slump in prices of major exports to refusal of real estate owners to pay their taxes Johnson Williams Assistant Director for Budget Development at the MFDP told FPA on Tuesday that once major companies in the country are struggling to sell their raw material on the world market due to slump in price or drop in demands the countrys revenue base would be severely impacted When price of rubber and iron ore drops obviously these companies would not be able to remit to government the expected revenue on their export he said These are factors still impeding Liberias foreign reserve Compared to the 2016 down to 2012 Liberias foreign reserves in 2017 had a record shrink Economists say Mr Weah must institute policies that would smoothen the ground for a favorable start President Weah in his Annual Message fell short of giving a clear cut formula to be adopted by his government to resuscitate the economy however he mentioned that his administration would introduce new legislation and policies which will be intended to achieve sustainable economic growth develop and expand agriculture and address our very large infrastructure deficit with particular emphasis on road construction and the provision of affordable and adequate electricity for all our people In the face of very high expectations of the new regime Liberians have to brace for a continuity of the status quo for an indefinite period of time as the new finance minister has said theres no quick fix to the countrys economic crisis During his confirmation hearing new Finance Minister Samuel Tweh said the rush to dedollarize the Liberian economy caused increase in the exchange rate between the US and the Liberian dollars He said Reversal of some dedollarization policy ongoing now would help the real sustainable solution There is no quick shortterm fix Tweh said The economy has to generate foreign exchange so we have to domesticate sources of production in Liberia and increase our import base on food especially rice The Finance and Development Planning Minister believes the first impact of the dedollarize policy is the reduction in the US dollars earning potential in the economic According to him the Central Bank has only been able to buy US$36 million annually in the last six years far short of the US$86 million that was annually bought This he said is a significant shortfall in foreign exchange which puts pressure on the Liberian dollars Anything we do in the short term will be to ensure that it be at an equilibrium that is manageable Unless there are investment policies to ensure that Liberian businesses get into manufacturing and the private sector is fully capitalizing to leverage the gains we will not be able to solve that problem over time and if we attempt to just change it over time by saying lets use Liberian dollars it is going to get worse Like President Weah stated in his Annual Message former Minister of Finance and now Director of the Graduate Program in Business & Administration at the University of Liberia Prof David M Farhat told FrontPageAfrica in an interview that the new regime wouldnt need cash to make the economy viable but by instituting the right policies that would help set the stage According to Farhat President Weahs administration would have to make some policy decisions which would not require money Nation is driven by money and driven by policy  he said Prof Farhat further advised that theres need for the Weahled government to after forming good policies build relationship with development partners to see how well they will help the country upon deciding on some of the things that require money that Liberia will be opting for The government needs to consider that its wage bill has been too large so it has to be reduced until the economy improves he said Inheriting the lowest foreign reserve in five years signals a rocky start for the new administration as the prices of the countrys main exports remains low on the world market Liberia

Government to review 16m disability benefit claims after Uturn  31 Jan 2018 Government to review 16m disability benefit claims after Uturn The government is to review about 16m disability benefit claims made over the past four years as part of major Uturn that will see an estimated 220000 claimants eventually receive backdated higher awards The exercise which could cost billions and take years comes after the government agreed earlier this monthxa0 not to challenge a high court rulingxa0 in December that said it had been “blatantly discriminatory” against people with mental health conditions The review involves identifying all claims made for personal independence payments Pip a benefit awarded to people to help them with the added costs of disability Pip formerly the disability living allowance is not means tested and is not linked to employment status Claimants are assessed by health professionalsxa0 employed by the private firms Atos and Capita xa0using a points system A claimant needs to score at least eight points for a standard award and 12 to qualify for an enhanced benefit award on each of two elements – daily living and mobility Last year ministers moved to stop people qualifying for enhanced payments within the mobility component of Pip for reasons of “psychological distress” The decision led to an outcry and legal challenge from campaigners In a high court ruling before Christmas Mr Justice Mostyn said: “In my judgment the 2017 regulations introduced criteria … which were blatantly discriminatory against those with mental health impairments and which cannot be objectively justified” In a written statement on Monday Sarah Newton minister for disabled people health and work said: “This will be a complex exercise and of considerable scale as we will be reconsidering approximately 16 million claims “Whilst we will be working at pace to complete this exercise it is important that we get it right” A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said it was not known how much the exercise would cost or how long it would take An official impact assessment published a year ago put the cost of the review at £37bn Debbie Abrahams shadow work and pensions secretary said: “Today’s admission that the department will have to reconsider 16m Pip claims to ensure that all claimants receive the correct award is shocking “The minister refused to publish a timetable of how many months or even years it will take for this ’complex exercise’ to be completed despite the secretary of state being pressed on this point in the Commons last week “The government was wrong to bring in the Pip regulations last year and it was wrong to ignore time and time again the views of the courts This sorry debacle is one of their own making They must now get a grip on the Pip process and ensure all those affected by this policy receive back payments as soon as possible” The DWP said it was directly contacting anyone affected and additional payments would be backdated to the effective date in each claim Claimants do not need to write to DWP in order to receive the correct award and will not have to undergo a new assessment Read the full article:xa0 https:wwwtheguardiancomsociety2018jan29governmenttoreview16mdisabilitybenefitclaimsafteruturnxa0 Roisin Norris Hi Im Roisin Norris Digital Marketing Executive at DisabledGo and I will be uploading blogs and news for you all to read

Govt comprehensively ignored advice over NHS datasharing deal Health committee calls for immediate ban on use of unacceptable agreement By Rebecca Hill 31xa0Janxa02018xa0atxa012:57 SHARE ▼ NHS Digital must put an immediate stop to patient datasharing deal with the UK Home Office for immigration enforcement MPs have said The deal which was put on official footing last year allows the Home Office to ask the National Health Service for nonclinical information – such as date of birth or last known address – for suspected immigration offences During a heated evidence session earlier this month doctors and patient groups told the Commons Health Committee that NHS Digital was operating to a lower standard of confidentiality than rest of the NHS and risked damaging public trust and deterring migrants from seeking healthcare In a withering letter PDF to NHS Digital chief exec Sarah Wilkinson published today the committees chair urged the body to cease sharing data with the Home Office and “immediately withdraw” the Memorandum of Understanding that underwrites the deal Chairwoman and former GP Sarah Wollaston slammed NHS Digital for carrying out an “inadequate consultation” on the deal that didn’t hear the concerns of NGOs the General Medical Council and the National Data Guardian “This lack of consultation has resulted in a situation where datasharing is taking place in a manner which is incompatible both with the guidance on confidentiality given by the GMC and the NHS Code of Confidentiality” she said “We find that situation unacceptable” Wollaston added that the government had “comprehensively ignored” the advice of Public Health England – the only health organisation she said that had been appropriately consulted PHE’s advice was that even the perception of datasharing could pose a serious risk to public health but the government had rejected it on the grounds it lacked “robust statistical evidence” This justification is “wholly unconvincing” Wollaston went on adding that the government’s request that PHE carry out a wider review “appears to be little more than windowdressing” Throughout the evidence session government officials argued that because the data was nonclinical it was at the lower end of confidentiality and emphasised that the MoU streamlined existing processes A statement sent from the Home Office to The Register about the health committees letter reiterated these points But Wollaston said the idea that a full consultation was unnecessary because the MoU operationalised existing functions “is wholly to miss the point” “It is not the MoU itself on which full consultation should have taken place but on the practice of datasharing for immigration enforcement which it enshrined” she wrote Central to the MPs concerns is that the government had failed to properly weigh the public interest in enforcing immigration laws with the public interest in a confidential health service There is “no mention anywhere in the MoU” of the latter but five paragraphs devoted to the former Wollaston said in the letter “The evidence which has been presented to us in the course of our brief inquiry suggests very strongly — contrary to your own assessment — that the public interest in the disclosure of information held by the NHS is heavily outweighed by the public interest in the maintenance of a confidential medical service” she told Wilkinson For these reasons Wollaston said that NHS Digital should suspend the MoU until it has carried out a more thorough review of the public interest test “We now expect NHS Digital to take this opportunity to demonstrate that it takes its duties in respect of confidentiality seriously” she concluded “If it does not we will expect to hold a further evidence session where you will be required to provide a very much more convincing case for the continued operation of this MoU than has been presented so far” NHS Digital confirmed it had received the letter and would “consider it carefully and will respond fully in due course” ®

Home › News › Government threatens 40 years in jail Matt DeHart forced into plea deal Government threatens 40 years in jail Matt DeHart forced into plea deal Matt DeHart’s long saga of government persecution including FBI torture refused asylum and seized property continues today as Matt has been cornered into taking a plea agreement to avoid a decadeslong prison sentence The deal in which the government would recommend Matt be sentenced to a total of seven and a half years — minus his three and a half years of time served — was Matt’s only hope to prevent something even worse: the government’s initial recommendation of forty years in jail or the charges’ maximum of seventy years and a halfmilliondollar fine Under the deal Matt would have to plead guilty to receiving teen “pornography” consisting of messages dated from 2008 that the US government decided to charge years later after they became aware that Matt discovered sensitive military files had been uploaded to a server he ran and that he was a WikiLeaks and Anonymous supporter Matt could fight the charges in court but he has already endured substantial abuse and the judge has sided with the government at nearly every turn Most recently Matt’s judge denied a motion to dismiss charges based on a vindictive prosecution despite the government’s overreach and lengthy delays Furthermore the federal judicial system is stacked against defendants: The conviction rate in federal criminal trials is 93% Matt’s father Paul DeHart has cited Aaron Swartz’s case as a turning point in the family’s fear of egregious prosecution Swartz committed suicide after facing more than 50 years in jail for rapidly downloading publicly available JSTOR documents Similarly in Matt’s case the government threatened an extremely long prison sentence of several decades — a highly disproportionate sentence for the allegations against him The government is likely agreeing to this deal in order to be done with Matt DeHart’s case to prevent a drawnout trial in which Matt’s political activity the files he unearthed and the treatment he endured could come to light This deal is not the end of the road: as Matt’s lawyer Tor Ekeland says “The court is not bound by the recommendations of the government and can impose any sentence it wishes up to the statutory maximum Customarily however courts sentence according to the parameters of a plea agreement between the government and defendant” Further we have to prevent future retaliation like the solitary confinement suffered by Barrett Brown Chelsea Manning and Jeremy Hammond Matt has already been tortured during interrogation and imprisoned for years before trial We must keep Matt’s sentencing in the public eye as only significant scrutiny will prevent further abuse and ensure as fair a trial as possible See the full plea deal below: Loading

Home Corruption Singaporeans will lose their freedom to criticise government Singaporeans will lose their freedom to criticise government January 28 2018 Getting angry over train breakdowns or increasing taxes Criticise the government online now while you can because Law Minister K Shanmugam has in his sleeve to ban criticisms The setup is ready the Select Committee is ready the Parliament is ready and all they need is sending the police officers to arrest the first “monkey” who probably wrote that K Shanmugam is a treacherous snake It is just a matter of time Singapore becomes totalitarian as Lee Hsien Loong badly wanted a legacy like his father Lee Hsien Loong wants people to cry louder at his state funeral like his father’s and he also wants his son Li Hongyi to be the next Prime Minister You can’t call them “corrupted” for drawing the world’s highest salaries you can’t punish them because they control even the judiciary and the President and neither can you vote them out because the election laws are written in their favour or maybe the election result is a fraud Temasek Holdings can lose billions of CPF money or even one day they decided to not return your CPF So what redress does Singaporeans have against the ruling party PAP Truthfully speaking none The lack of avenues to feedback negatively resulted in the loss of respect for the Ministers and these are apparently giving them headaches They can’t rest well knowing that there are a thousand commentators behind their back badmouthing their every move and the issue is they are getting desperate – or desperate enough to pay “social media influencers” S$1000 each to praise them As of now disrespecting a Minister is still legal until Lee Hsien Loong one day decided he had enough and extend the lese majesty law a law making it a crime to insult the monarchy Yes you heard me right: extend Do you know that insulting Lee Kuan Yew warrants a jail sentence under a new law written in 2016 ” The name or image or likeness of Mr Lee should be accorded dignity and respect ” Even at officialdemarcated rallies like at the Nomination centres do you know that you will also be arrested for “public nuisance” Photo of armoured vehicles outside Nomination Centre from CNA Two trucks of armoured vehicles and hundreds of policemen were on standby during Halimah Yacob’s recent Nomination Day  ready to arrest any hecklers who intend to stage the same ruckus as they did for Tony Tan Aside from their usual legal arsenals like defamation lawsuits and the abuse of the Internal Security Department now taken up by the Special Investigation Section of the Police the ruling party also hired paid trolls to harass critics and disrupt discussions on public forums It is increasingly suffocating in Singapore as the years goes by and it will only get worse as the ruling party lose popularity further There is no stopping this is how they have always operated So Singaporeans before the ruling party regime take away your right insult them all you can now Singaporeans will lose their freedom to criticise government was last modified: January 28th 2018 by admin 
Home Keynotes Reviews Video Books Columns Contact About Government unions do not save taxpayers money One great myth promoted by government unions is that goods and services can be delivered more effectively if the profit line is cut out of budgets that involve government contracts to the private sector This notion showed up again on these pages last week  and with it the implicit claim that absent profit public services will be more efficient if only evermore services are ordered up by politicians run through government departments and delivered by publicsector unions This argument with only surface appeal courtesy of the occasional failure of some privatesector contractors the federal governments privately contracted Phoenix pay system is an example ignores the useful dynamics inevitable through competition and also privatization: the promotion of actual efficiencies an end to public subsidies actual market pricing and the potential for quality control including the ability to hire and fire suppliers Consider each in turn On efficiency consider 1980s and 90sera privatization examples liquor stores in Alberta airline railway energy and utility companies in Canada and around the world One reason for such privatization efforts was to end costly subsidies from the public purse For example one estimate of federal subsidies for Canadian National Railway between 1923 and 1993 pegged the cost at $96billion in 1995 dollars Despite such subsidies or perhaps because of them that government Crown was still $25billion in debt by the time it was privatized in 1995  Another reason to endorse competition over governmentrun businesses or reflexive inhouse provision the latter of which often means a de facto monopoly: to gain clear price signals Politicians often demand Crowns keep prices lower than the cost of providing the service to please the voting public they also restrict the necessary investment in capital stock to that political end Thats why in select cases prices rise after privatization: Because governments fiddled for years or decades with proper pricing for political ends Ontarios power system comes repeatedly to mind That noted prices dont always rise after privatization and this is because competition forces efficiencies that tend to drive down prices in real terms Human Progress has chronicled the cost of a 13cubicmetre microwave in 1979: $39995 US and which took 61 hours of labour to create By 2015 that same size oven took just three hours to build and cost consumers $5913 Privatesector innovation and competition will do that Service and selection is another reason to either ensure competitive bidding andor privatize an activity In 1992 Albertans were offered 208 government liquor stores – in essence one nearmonopoly chain and 65 private stores that carried 2200 products In 2015 22 years after the 199293 privatization effort Albertans could choose between 1586 private liquor stores that carried 22292 products As for Alberta liquor prices as with any private competitive market they vary widely My 2002 study found that after removing taxes and government markups out of 1845 products available in both Alberta and at government liquor stores in British Columbia 82 per cent were cheaper in Alberta Lastly on quality control failure in the private sector is hardly unknown Just ask anyone whos had to fire an employee or end a contract early It is thus not surprising that a privatesector contractor who wins government work will occasionally fail to deliver The Phoenix pay system for the federal government is a recent example although critics of outsourcing often skip this relevant point: It was federal civil servants who underestimated the complexity of switching to the new system A properly written contract allows governments to end a business relationship or refuse to allow another bid This occurred last summer when Bombardier was shut out of a $32billion New York competition to provide subway cars As the company itself admitted  New Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority refused to allow Bombardiers bid to proceed because of the companys past delivery delays and poor performance A useful question: When have politicians – who bear ultimate responsibility for expended tax dollars – ever ended a governments relationship with one of its own underperforming departments or government unions for not delivering on time on budget and with the appropriate quality Problems in services and goods often crop up when monopolies or nearmonopolies are allowed to capture a service or the production of a product That is why giving over even more government work to more government unions already entrenched and which rarely face competition is a poor idea Those who think otherwise should try this experiment: Visit a usedcar dealership and tell the salesperson you have no intention of shopping anywhere else An optimal level of service and price will not be the end result ~ Mark

Home sales cool in December Prices Not so much Housing is a top concern among the state’s electorate More than half of California voters say the state’s housing affordability crisis is so bad that they’ve considered moving and 60 percent of likely voters support rent control according to a statewide poll last fall  Both sides of the rent control battle have also poured money into ballot box fights in recent years There is widespread agreement among Democrats and Republicans and between progrowth activists and those concerned about tenant displacement that California must build more housing to address its affordability problems The state needs about 200000 housing units per year to keep pace with rising demand though it is building an average of roughly 80000 units per year xa0 Rents in California the most expensive in the nation have gone up more than 40 percent in major metropolitan areas since 2015 according to a January housing analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California Median rents for all types of rental housing range from $1595 in Sacramento to $4395 in San Francisco to $2933 in Los Angeles according to the real estate listing service Zillow Nearly half of Californians – 47 percent – say the state’s high housing costs are a financial strain on themselves and their families according to the Public Policy Institute analysis That figure is higher among renters with 61 percent saying they are financially burdened Backers of the CostaHawkins repeal say building the housing California needs will take decades and tenants facing big rent increases need help now “There’s no building our way out of this crisis” said Damien Goodmon director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s “Housing is a Human Right” campaign “We have no illusion  that this will be costly and ugly” The state Chamber of Commerce labeled a bill that also sought to repeal CostaHawkins a “job killer” It died earlier this year in the Assembly  setting up the ballot box fight “I expect it to qualify” said Allan Zaremberg the Chamber’s president and CEO “We’re concerned about increases in the cost of housing and being able to keep people in California The consequences of a strong economy and an inability to keep up with the demand for housing is a problem we need to solve but we believe that rent control diminishes investment in housing opportunities “It costs more money to build in California” Zaremberg said “If you can’t recover those costs you’re less likely to put your money into a development” Jeff Pemstein a board member for the state Building Industry Association acknowledged that economically thriving cities like San Francisco which has rent control have experienced a building boom but he argued developers in other markets like Sacramento cannot absorb the high costs of construction labor and permitting on top of rent control “People will pay astronomical prices to live in niche markets like San Francisco They are super desirable so you can afford to put up with a lot of inconvenience but the vast majority of California cannot afford to do that” said Pemstein also division president for Towne Development of Sacramento which finances all types of development including rental housing and singlefamily homes Financial backer blames Legislature Weinstein behind two unsuccessful 2016 ballot initiatives that sought to require condoms in porn production and to cap state prescription drug costs to the lowest price paid by the US Department of Veteran Affairs said he’d prefer the Legislature to take up repeal but that doesn’t appear likely He said he’s financing the proposed initiative because he has witnessed firsthand what he perceives as consequences of the state’s housing problems “We’re seeing a growing homelessness crisis our employees have to travel farther and farther to work and people are being displaced by the thousands” Weinstein said “Everything the Legislature is doing is geared toward creating luxury housing not preserving the housing stock for people who are low and moderateincome” xa0 He said local communities ought to be able to address the issue themselves “The fundamental question here isn’t even the merits of rent control The real question is why shouldn’t cities be deciding this” Weinstein said “Why is the Legislature taking away all the authority over land use from cities” Weinstein declined to say how much money he is prepared to spend but it would likely be millions Through his campaign committee Weinstein spent more than $18 million on his drug pricing initiative – the most expensive in 2016 – and more than $3 million on the condoms measure The apartment association is prepared to spend tens of millions Bannon said “If Mr Weinstein spends $10 to $20 million we would have to spend at least that much” Bannon said “If he spends $40 million we’d have to spend $40 million” Backlash over high housing costs has spurred local rent control campaigns across the state over the past three years The apartment association has spent about $15 million to beat back local campaigns that sought to impose rent control on multifamily apartment complexes built before 1995 proposed through local ballot measures or city councils Its attempts to defeat rent control have failed in some areas with Richmond voters in 2016 passing a rent control ordinance that limits how much landlords are allowed to raise rents to 3 percent annually It has succeeded in other parts of the Bay Area including Santa Rosa where a 2017 proposal failed with 525 percent of voters opposed Meanwhile local rent control campaigns are budding this year in Sacramento Santa Cruz Long Beach Inglewood and Pasadena Repealing CostaHawkins would allow them to cover more units in local ordinances if they so choose Assemblyman David Chiu DSan Francisco who served as president of the city’s Board of Supervisors for six years before being elected to state office said cities with existing laws like San Francisco could benefit from repeal “While not perfect rent control has been one of the very few policies that has protected some level of economic diversity in San Francisco” Chiu said “If rent control disappeared tomorrow our city would only be affordable to those who make sixfigure incomes It has worked in San Francisco and elsewhere  Cities are crying out for relief” 
http:ifttt2nuhYfX January 31 2018 LONDON Reuters – Britain’s government said on Wednesday it would hand over to parliament what it called an initial analysis of the impact of Brexit trying to deflect accusations that ministers are badly prepared for leaving the EU The leaked report has struck at the heart of government Brexit strategy with one minister suggesting that analysis by officials should be discounted and another urging the government to reconsider its stance It has piled pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May who is under fire from some in her own Conservative Party for lacking leadership and a clear Brexit plan as she negotiates a deal to end more than 40 years of union The main opposition Labour Party is trying to force the government into handing over the report entitled “EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing” and dated January 2018 by using an ancient parliamentary procedure Parliament’s treasury committee also called on the government to publish immediately “Let me start by saying that the government will not be opposing this motion today” junior Brexit minister Robin Walker told parliament saying that if lawmakers voted in favor of publishing the report it could be seen “on a strictly confidential basis” The report which the government has called a partial piece of work that had yet to be signed off by ministers said the economy would be worse off after Brexit whether Britain left the EU with a free trade deal single market access or with no deal at all On Tuesday another junior Brexit minister Steve Baker rebuffed calls for the government to release the full report by saying it was not ready and that lawmakers should be cautious because analysis by officials was often wrong Phillip Lee a minister at the justice department was rebuked on Wednesday for expressing on Twitter his suggestion that if the report were true “there would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging” Government aides have said the paper leaked to BuzzFeed News had not been signed off by ministers nor had considered the government’s preferred goal of a bespoke future relationship with the EU after leaving But it has raised further questions over how prepared the government is for the complicated negotiations to end Britain’s membership of the EU “There is a serious point here” said Labour’s Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer “Is it seriously government policy that impact assessments are so unreliable that it is better to proceed without them” “We need an informed debate including the likely economic impact of different approaches – publication is needed in the name of transparency” he told parliament Reporting By Elizabeth Piper David Milliken and Andrew MacAskill editing by Stephen Addison Vía One America News Network http:ifttt2DSibVm Advertisements

Jan 31 2018 9:09 AM 3820 facebook linkedin twitter email copy link Reuters The United States DOJ and SEC are reportedly investigating an Apple software update with a power management feature that can slow down older iPhones Apple says its aware of government agencies asking questions and is responding to them Apple said in a statement on Wednesday that it was responding to government agencies asking questions about a 2017 iPhone software update that slowed down older phones The US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have started investigating Apple software updates because of the slowdown issue Bloomberg reported on Tuesday  Apple says the reason for the software feature is to prevent unexpected iPhone shutdowns not to encourage users to update to a newer iPhone A phone with the feature turned on can take longer to launch apps and can display lower frame rates but its also less likely to randomly reboot As we told our customers in December we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades Apple said in the statement Some Apple fans believe that the company released the software update to get them to upgrade to newer iPhones leading to lawsuits Apple explained in December that older batteries in some iPhone models including the iPhone 6 6S and 7 can no longer meet peak power needs when theyre old or used Apple has offered to replace any affected batteries for $29 down from the companys previous $79 price Apple also plans to release a software update in the next few months that will show users their battery health and turn off the power management feature that could potentially slow down an older phone The purported investigations by the DOJ and the SEC wouldnt be the first pushes for more information from Apple Groups in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have questioned Apple and the company faces more than 45 classaction lawsuits from consumers as well as international probes too We dont confirm or deny investigations a representative for the Department of Justice said on Tuesday Read Apples full response: About a year ago we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on certain iPhones with older batteries We know that iPhones have become an important part of the daily lives of our customers and our intention was to improve the customer experience We sought to further improve the customer experience in December by announcing a significant discount on replacement batteries for certain iPhones We also announced that we began developing a new iOS feature to show battery health and which would recommend when the user should consider replacing their battery These actions were taken to further assist our customers and help extend the life of their iPhones In addition users will be able to see if the power management feature is being used to prevent unexpected shutdowns and turn if off if they so choose These features will be included in a developer release next month and a user release this Spring As we told our customers in December we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love Making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them

government employees are vulnerable to furlough or temporary unpaid leave Other “essential” workers including those dealing with public safety and national security keep working some with and others without pay After previous government shutdowns Congress passed measures to ensure that essential and nonessential employees received retroactive pay The last shutdown in October 2013 lasted more than two weeks More than 800000 federal employees were furloughed Here is what happened then and some recent updates from officials: MILITARY: The Defense Department said on Friday that a shutdown would not impact the US military’s war in Afghanistan or its operations against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria All military personnel on active duty would remain on normal duty status Civilian personnel in nonessential operations would be furloughed JUSTICE: The Justice Department has many “essential” workers Under its shutdown contingency plan about 95000 of the department’s almost 115000 staff would keep working FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT: The stock marketpolicing Securities and Exchange Commission funds itself by collecting fees from the financial industry but its budget is set by Congress It has said in the past it would be able to continue operations temporarily in a shutdown But it would have to furlough workers if Congress went weeks before approving new funding The Commodity Futures Trading Commission meanwhile would have to furlough 95 percent of its employees immediately An agency spokeswoman said the derivatives regulator could call in additional staff however in the event of financial market emergency NATIONAL PARKS: National parks closed in 2013 and it resulted in a loss of 750000 daily visitors said the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association The National Park Service NPS estimated the shutdown cost $500 million in lost visitor spending in areas around the parks and the Smithsonian museums WASHINGTON TOURIST SIGHTS: In 2013 popular tourist sites such as the Smithsonian closed with barricades going up at the Lincoln Memorial the Library of Congress and the National Archives The National Zoo closed and its popular “Panda Cam” went dark The NPS which oversees many Washington landmarks including the National Mall has said it has a plan in place so that “First Amendment activities” can continue during a shutdown TAXES: The Internal Revenue Service furloughed 90 percent of its staff in 2013 the liberal Center for American Progress said About $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed as a result according to the Office of Management and Budget or OMB MAIL DELIVERY: Deliveries are expected to continue as usual because the US Postal Service gets no tax dollars for daytoday operations TRAVEL: Air and rail travelers did not feel a big impact in 2013 because security officers and air traffic controllers remained at work Passport processing continued with some delays COURTS: The Administrative Office of the US Courts has said federal courts including the Supreme Court could continue to operate normally for about three weeks without additional funding HEALTHCARE: Signups for the newly created Obamacare health insurance exchanges began as scheduled in 2013 The Medicare health insurance program for the elderly continued largely without disruption A program at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track

no change in payment dates and field offices remained open but offered limited services There were delays in the review process for new applicants LOANS: Processing of mortgages and other loans was delayed when lenders could not access government services such as income and Social Security number verification The Small Business Administration was unable to process about 700 applications for $140 million in loans until the shutdown ended OMB said VETERANS: Most employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs would not be subject to furlough VA hospitals would remain open and veterans’ benefits would continue but education assistance and case appeals would be delayed the department said FOOD INSPECTIONS: Department of Agriculture meat inspectors stayed on the job Agricultural statistical reports ceased publication The USDA’s website went dark ENERGY: The Department of Energy said on Friday that since most of its appropriations are for multiple years employees should report to work as

January 26 2018 09:23 AM JEFFERSON CITY Thirtyeight states have outlawed revenge porn but not Missouri A bipartisan group of the state’s lawmakers hopes to change that this year This is legislators’ fourth attempt in recent years to prohibit revenge porn and it comes at a time when Gov Eric Greitens is under criminal investigation for allegedly taking a photo of a woman with whom he was having an affair and threatening to show it to others if she talked about their relationship The revenge porn legislation would not apply to the allegations in Greitens’ case — he is not accused of showing any photo to anyone else — but the scandal surrounding his 2015 affair has raised awareness of the issue lawmakers said Never miss a local story Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access SUBSCRIBE NOW “We understand I think even more now with the governor’s situation the seriousness of this” said Rep Stacey Newman a St Louis County Democrat who sits on the committee that heard the bill earlier this week Rep Kevin Engler a Farmington Republican who sponsored a version of the bill in the past expressed doubt that lawmakers would shy from the issue because of its connection to the scandal “I don’t think that there’s anybody in this building that’s job is fervently defending the governor” Engler said “None of us are defending him” The bill would make it a class D felony to share sexually explicit images or recordings without the consent of the person pictured While Missouri’s invasion of privacy statute outlaws a person taking a sexually explicit images of a person without their consent there is no state law that specifically addresses the circulation of the image According to the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative  a nonprofit that advocates for victims of nonconsensual pornography and online abuse 38 states and the District of Columbia have such laws Mary Anne Franks the legislative and tech policy director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative said a range of situations can fall under the scope of nonconsensual pornography including photos captured with or without consent videotaped sexual assaults and hacking into someone’s iCloud account and sharing images from it In the digital age the viral and pervasive nature of images being spread on the internet can have lasting effects said Colleen Coble CEO of the Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence “It’s devastating You have no control It can be damaging to your personal status” Coble said “It causes significant emotional distress Oftentimes the images are sent out worldwide People have lost their jobs They have felt that they need to move” Without a law in Missouri it’s more difficult for victims to seek protection said Sandy Davidson an attorney and Missouri School of Journalism professor “It makes it difficult for prosecutors because prosecutors have to be able to point to an exact law under which somebody can be prosecuted” Davidson said Victims can ask to have their images removed by many search engines and social media platforms as outlined in the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative’s guide  And in some cases there are instances in which nonconsensual pornography may fall under the scope of related laws providing a means of recourse However Franks said that shouldn’t be used as a justification to not establish a law specifically addressing revenge porn “It’s really a question of justice It’s vitally important as a symbolic and social message for the state to say ‘This is not something that we consider acceptable You are not allowed to use people’s private information in this way’xa0” Franks said The issue has been before the legislature for a handful of years now but it has never been debated by the full House or Senate Rep Jim Neely a Cameron Republican is sponsoring the bill for a second year and said it was important the issue continues to be raised “There’s lobby for roads There’s lobby for energy There’s lobby for a lot of things out there” Neely said “but there’s no lobby for some of these individual problems that people have issues with” Engler attributed Missouri’s lack of a revenge porn law partially to a reluctance on the part of male lawmakers to discuss the issue “I don’t think the chairman or a lot of the men feel comfortable talking about these issues which is in my estimation ridiculous” Engler said Newman said with the national conversation surrounding consent she thinks progress will be made this year “Only 20 percent of us here in the legislature are women but I think more men are getting it too — that no one wants their wives daughters sisters in this situation” Missouri’s lack of a revenge porn law has received increased attention amid Greitens’ scandal While highprofile scandals can have the effect of spurring legislative change Franks said that sometimes it can have the opposite effect by causing legislators to avoid the issue Regardless Franks said she hopes that the scandal has caused more Missourians to consider adopting the legislation “If we think it’s right and just that people can give out their Social Security numbers to certain people” Franks said “or they can provide their driver’s license to certain people or their credit cards — without that information then becoming public knowledge — then we should think the same thing about private sexually explicit information”

January 30 2018   7:13 AM  16 days ago Exclusive: Tests link Syrian government stockpile to largest sarin attack  sources Anthony Deutsch 8 Min Read THE HAGUE Reuters  The Syrian government’s chemical weapons stockpile has been linked for the first time by laboratory tests to the largest sarin nerve agent attack of the civil war diplomats and scientists told Reuters supporting Western claims that government forces under President Bashar alAssad were behind the atrocity Laboratories working for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons compared samples taken by a UN mission in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta after the Aug 21 2013 attack when hundreds of civilians died of sarin gas poisoning to chemicals handed over by Damascus for destruction in 2014 For a graphic on chemical attacks click tmsnrtrs2pKDWOY  The tests found “markers” in samples taken at Ghouta and at the sites of two other nerve agent attacks in the towns of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib governorate on April 4 2017 and Khan alAssal Aleppo in March 2013 two people involved in the process said “We compared Khan Sheikhoun Khan alAssal Ghouta” said one source who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the findings “There were signatures in all three of them that matched” The same test results were the basis for a report by the OPCWUnited Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism in October which said the Syrian government was responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun attack which killed dozens The findings on Ghouta whose details were confirmed to Reuters by two separate diplomatic sources were not released in the October report to the UN Security Council because they were not part of the team’s mandate They will nonetheless bolster claims by the United States Britain and other Western powers that Assad’s government still possesses and uses banned munitions in violation of several  Security Council resolutions and the Chemical Weapons Convention The OPCW declined to comment Syria has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the conflict now in its seventh year and has blamed the chemical attacks in the rebelheld territory of Ghouta on the insurgents themselves Russia has also denied that Syrian government forces have carried out chemical attacks and has questioned the reliability of the OCPW inquiries Officials in Moscow have said the rebels staged the attacks to discredit the Assad government and whip up international condemnation Under a USRussian deal after the Ghouta attack in 2013 Damascus joined the OPCW and agreed to permanently eliminate its chemical weapons program including destroying a 1300tonne stockpile of industrial precursors that has now been linked to the Ghouta attack But inspectors have found proof of an ongoing chemical weapons program in Syria including the systematic use of chlorine barrel bombs and sarin which they say was ordered at the highest levels of government The sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun in April last year prompted US President Donald Trump to order a missile strike against the Shayrat air base from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched Diplomatic and scientific sources said efforts by Syria and Russia to discredit the UNOPCW tests establishing a connection to Ghouta have so far come up with nothing Russia’s blocking of resolutions at the Security Council seeking accountability for war crimes in Syria gained new relevance when Russia stationed its aircraft at Shayrat in 2015 Washington fired missiles at Shayrat in April 2017 saying the Syrian air force used it to stage the Khan Sheikhoun sarin attack on April 4 a few days earlier killing more than 80 people FILE PHOTO: A UN chemical weapons expert wearing a gas mask holds a plastic bag containing samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus Syria August 29 2013 REUTERSMohamed AbdullahFile Photo No Russian military assets are believed to have been hit but Moscow warned at the time it could have serious consequences In June the Pentagon said it had seen what appeared to be preparations for another chemical attack at the same airfield prompting Russia to say it would respond proportionately if Washington took preemptive measures against Syrian forces there “SERIOUS LAB WORK” The chemical tests were carried out at the request of the UNOPCW inquiry which was searching for potential links between the stockpile and samples from Khan Sheikhoun The analysis results raised the possibility that they would provide a link to other sarin attacks the source said Two compounds in the Ghouta sample matched those also found in Khan Sheikhoun one formed from sarin and the stabilizer hexamine and another specific fluorophosphate that appears during sarin production the tests showed “Like in all science it should be repeated a couple of times but it was serious matching and serious laboratory work” the source said xa0xa0xa0 Independent experts however said the findings are the strongest scientific evidence to date that the Syrian government was behind Ghouta the deadliest chemical weapons attack since the Halabja massacres of 1988 during the IranIraq war “A match of samples from the 2013 Ghouta attacks to tests of chemicals in the Syrian stockpile is the equivalent of DNA evidence: definitive proof” said Amy Smithson a US nonproliferation expert The hexamine finding “is a particularly significant match” Smithson said because it is a chemical identified as a unique hallmark of the Syrian military’s process to make sarin “This match adds to the mountain of physical evidence that points conclusively without a shadow of doubt to the Syrian government” she said NO CHANCE REBELS BEHIND GHOUTA Smithson and other sources familiar with the matter said it would have been virtually impossible for the rebels to carry out a coordinated largescale strike with poisonous munitions even if they had been able to steal the chemicals from the government’s stockpile “I don’t think there is a cat in hell’s chance that rebels or Islamic State were responsible for the Aug 21 Ghouta attack” said Hamish de BrettonGordon an independent specialist in biological and chemical weapons The UNOPCW inquiry which was disbanded in November  after being blocked by Syria’s ally Russia at the UN Security Council also found that Islamic State had used the less toxic blistering agent sulfur mustard gas on a small scale in Syria The Ghouta attack by comparison was textbook chemical warfare Smithson and de BrettonGordon said perfectly executed by forces trained to handle sarin a toxin which is more difficult to usexa0because it must be mixed just before delivery Surfacetosurface rockets delivered hundreds of liters of sarin in perfect weather conditions that made them as lethal as possible: low temperatures and wind in the early hours of the morning when the gas would remain concentrated and kill sleeping victims many of them children Preattack air raids with conventional bombs shattered windows and doors and drove people into shelters where the heavy poison seeped down into underground hiding places Aerial bombing afterwards

January 31 2018 05:45 AM Is the frosty relationship between the University of California and the Legislature starting to thaw Tuition hikes surging nonresident enrollment and a series of administrative scandals have generated intense outrage at the Capitol in recent years culminating in a heated hearing last May in which lawmakers expressed frustration over what they felt was UC’s continued “arrogance” and resistance to change But a followup hearing Tuesday suggested there has been a decided deescalation in tensions in the intervening eight months Amid pointed questions for UC President Janet Napolitano about her role in interfering with a critical state audit of her office last year many lawmakers in attendance expressed their pride in one of the world’s most prestigious university systems and their desire to rebuild trust with UC Napolitano assured lawmakers that she did not direct her staff to interfere with the audit and she would have stopped them had she been aware Never miss a local story Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access SUBSCRIBE NOW “Perhaps my chief of staff and deputy chief of staff were doing what they thought I wanted them to do” she said “Had I known what they were doing I would have intervened and stopped it” The audit released last April  found that Napolitano’s office systematically overcharged UC campuses to fund its central administrative functions and had amassed $175 million in undisclosed reserves even as it raised tuition But state auditor Elaine Howle also slammed the university for inhibiting her efforts to determine whether the Office of the President’s expansive duties and nearly 1700 employees could be slimmed down A survey for UC’s ten campuses to assess what administrative functions they found valuable was abandoned after Howle discovered that Napolitano’s office ordered significant revisions to critical responses Napolitano said she accepted full responsibility for approving a plan that required campuses to provide their surveys to her office for review before submitting them to the auditor which resulted in the changes to negative answers She said she merely wanted to ensure that campuses understood the surveys and provided accurate information “I made a mistake and I want to apologize for it” she said “It’s clear to me now that no one at the Office of the President should have been involved in reviewing the survey responses” “Perhaps I should have paid greater attention” she added Legislators called the hearing Tuesday after an independent investigation ordered by UC’s governing board concluded that the Office of the President directly and intentionally interfered with the audit Former California Supreme Court Justice Carlos Moreno who led the investigation said he spoke with 38 witnesses and examined more than 420000 documents He determined that Napolitano’s office interfered with the audit on multiple levels: both implicitly by notifying campuses that it would review their surveys before submission which may have created a chilling effect on responses and explicitly by changing responses so that they reflected more positively on the university But he said he found no evidence that Napolitano was aware critical survey answers were changed a process carried out by her former chief of staff Seth Grossman and deputy chief of staff Bernie Jones Both of them resigned last November shortly before Moreno’s report was released Some committee members expressed skepticism over his conclusions including Assemblyman Phil Ting DSan Francisco who suggested that UC engaged in a “coverup” to keep facts away from the auditor and by extension the Legislature and the public “I find it hard to believe that a chief of staff acted without permission from their boss” he said “That’s usually when a chief of staff gets fired” There was also lingering anger directed at Napolitano Assemblywoman Sharon QuirkSilva DFullerton who has previously called on Napolitano to resign  reiterated that she did not feel Napolitano faced sufficient consequences for her actions “I’ve lost confidence” QuirkSilva said Nevertheless when Napolitano finally appeared before the panel more than two hours into the hearing the interrogations were muted A few lawmakers urged their colleagues to hold off on the reactionary policymaking that has resulted in recent session as the Legislature has attempted to wrest back some of UC’s autonomy “I want to say a word of caution that as we move forward and we move forward in this legislative year that we think and think deeply and long before we take action” Assemblyman Jose Medina DRiverside said George Kieffer chair of the UC Board of Regents said the university took Moreno’s report seriously In addition to policy changes to prevent interference in future audits he said the regents released a statement admonishing Napolitano’s actions and required her to apologize Kieffer added

January 31 2018 at 7:18 am | UPDATED: January 31 2018 at 11:41 am When Stephen Paddock started firing an assault rifle into a crowd at a Las Vegas concert this past October he wasn’t aiming at any particular person But as a result of his indiscriminate shooting 58 innocent people died That’s mass murder by any definition In the past year members of Congress have passed a new tax law and failed to vote on other bills while the president and his appointees have lifted dozens of rules and regulations issued by their predecessors These actions and inactions too will result in the deaths of innocent Americans even if our elected representatives do not know exactly which ones What shall we call that crime A 2009xa0study conducted before the Affordable Care Act became law showed that uninsured workingage Americans have a 40 percent higher fatality rate than those privately insured The study indicates about 880 lives per year are saved for each additional million people insured The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax bill just passed into law will lead to an additional four million more Americans uninsured in 2019 and 13 million more by 2027 This implies over 3500 additional deaths with that number more than tripling by the late 2020s People also die due to congressional inaction In 1994 Congress passed a law to ban assault weapons that expired in 2004 During the decade the law was in effect the average number of deaths in mass shootings was 10 From 2005 through 2016 the average increased to 32 including the 20 children murdered at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 but not those who died in Las Vegas this past October Republicans in both Houses havexa0quashed effortsxa0to reimpose the assault weapons ban Congressional inaction then could have contributed to more people losing their lives Initiatives undertaken by the executive branch this past year cause deaths too Thexa0EPA estimatedxa0that the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan would prevent 2700 to 6600 premature deaths each year And what’s happened to that plan Scott Pruitt the Trumpappointed Senateconfirmed head of the EPA has ordered it killed Almost every week steps are taken that will cost human lives in the long run — lifting environmental protections approving dangerous pesticides reducing the budget of the National Institutes of Health ignoring greenhouse gas emissions and pulling out of climate change agreements And now that the new tax law has been passed Republicans are making noise aboutxa0targeting spendingxa0on Medicare and Medicaid which together provide health coverage for 75 million people I myself am a mystery writer and reader I recall that Margaret Truman daughter of our 33rd president published “Murder in the White House” and “Murder on Capitol Hill” back in the 1980s They were of course fictional whodunnits Related Articles 
Jeff Flake on Trump Calling Dreamers Illegal: You Could Feel the Groans from a Lot of People Including Me  Breitbart COMMENTS ↓ Sen Jeff Flake RAZ chided President Donald Trump during his State of the Union address on Tuesday for referring to “Dreamers” as “illegal” Sen Flake told reporters on Tuesday night after the State of the Union address “You could feel the groans from a lot of people including me” President Trump suggested in his State of the Union speech that hisxa0administration will grant a pathway to citizenship to more than 18 million immigrants provided they meet certain standards Trump explained : The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 18 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age — that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration Under our plan those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States Breitbart News factchecked the assertion that President Trump proposed amnesty for 18 million Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA illegal aliens would remain limited to just 18 million and found that it would likely expand to include roughly 45 million illegal immigrants obtaining citizenship Breitbart News reported “Currently there are nearly 800000 illegal aliens enrolled in Obama’s DACA program The White House amnesty plan would potentially sextuple this number of illegal aliens receiving amnesty and a pathway to citizenship” Critics and experts also suggest that a DACA amnesty could become openended and neverending similar to the 1986 illegal immigrant amnesty READ MORE STORIES ABOUT: 
Jeff J MitchellGetty Images Trump Has Turned the GOP Into the Party of Eugenics The longdiscredited theory is newly relevant in 2017—but maybe its always been embedded in the Republican platform By Sarah Jones February 15 2017 “What is meant by improvement” Sir Francis Galton asked the Sociology Society of the University of London in 1904 At the time of his speech Galton was already 35 years deep into a career promoting what he termed “eugenics” the idea that the human race could improve itself through selective breeding—through propagating good traits and quarantining the bad ones “All creatures would agree that it was better to be healthy than sick vigorous than weak wellfitted than illfitted for their part in life” he explained “So with men” Eugenics enjoys the dubious distinction of being one of the most thoroughly discredited theories in scientific history It is most closely associated with the Nazis and their obsession with racial superiority but the Nazis did not invent it any more than they invented racism: It began in Great Britain and swiftly spread to the United States Beginning with Indiana in 1907 32 states adopted laws “authorizing the sterilization of people judged to have hereditary defects” Adam Cohen writes in his book Imbeciles “They called for sterilizing anyone with ‘defective’ traits such as epilepsy criminality alcoholism or ‘dependency’ another word for poverty” Americans adopted eugenics so enthusiastically that 70000 people were sterilized under laws that eventually influenced the policies of the Third Reich  But eugenics though discredited has never been abandoned In fact the most powerful people in America appear to enthusiastically embrace the idea that humans can be divided into inherently superior and inferior specimens and treated accordingly “You have to be born lucky” President Donald Trump told Oprah Winfrey in 1988  “in the sense that you have to have the right genes” His biographer Michael D’Antonio explained to Frontline that Trump and his family subscribe “to a racehorse theory of human development They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man you get a superior offspring” So does Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon if the reports are to be believed Sources told The New York Times this November that despite his devout Catholicism Bannon “occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners” Adam Serwer of The Atlantic reported in January that Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the Immigration Act of 1924 in a 2015 interview with Bannon which could be an insight into the views of both these immigration hardliners: The act required wouldbe immigrants to specify whether they’d ever spent time in prison or the “almshouse” and if their parents had ever been confined to a psychiatric hospital The work of Trump adviser Michael Anton also reveals a grim obsession with genetic purity “‘Diversity’ is not ‘our strength’ it’s a source of weakness tension and disunion” he wrote in the Unz Review last year As the Huffington Post noted at the time the same essay claimed that the aviator Charles Lindbergh’s fascist America First Committee had been unfairly maligned Lindbergh was a eugenicist who admired the Nazis: He once wrote that flying “is one of those priceless possessions which permit the White Race to live at all in a sea of Yellow Black and Brown” Of course none of the people in Trump’s inner circle would describe themselves as eugenicists They would call themselves capitalists patriots and Christians And yet the Trump administration’s overt obsession with white supremacy—which the 2016 election showed to be the ugly beating heart of the conservative movement—has imbued the platform of the Republican Party with a lurid tinge changing our understanding of its disdain not only for minorities but for the weak the poor and the disabled The GOP may loathe the term—indeed conservatives often accuse liberal abortion supporters of being the real eugenicists—but the party’s agenda in many ways channels the spirit of eugenics even if it does not accept the theory in a literal sense If you think I’m exaggerating just consider for a moment what it is like to be an American with “bad” genes I was not born lucky at least not as Donald Trump defines it: My brother and I have a rare genetic disease that affects our red blood cells It isn’t terminal but it also isn’t pleasant It is expensive and painful and the only thing I’ve learned from living with it is that all emergency rooms smell exactly the same It also means that I am not sure if I should have children It feels wrong to knowingly bequeath a disease to anyone It feels especially wrong to do so in America a country that still does not recognize an inalienable right to health care Trump’s comments are merely an open expression of a longstanding institutionalized disdain for the poor and the sick He helms a party at ease with the fact that American pharmaceutical companies can charge $89000 for a lifeextending muscular dystrophy drug America charges you for childbirth for checkups for cancer it will bankrupt you over blood transfusions and ambulance rides I had medical bills in collections before I’d even finished college mostly due to a deductible so high that I paid to see specialists out of pocket Trump’s comments are merely an open expression of a longstanding institutionalized disdain for the poor and the sick Matters have recently improved Thanks to the Affordable Care Act insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with “preexisting conditions” But dismantling the Affordable Care Act is a top priority for this administration and for the Republicans in Congress if they can ever get out from under a swiftly growing mountain of scandals  At the heart of the push to repeal Obamacare is the idea that dependency is a cancer on the republic and should be excised Both parties have absorbed this idea to different extents The ACA is too marketdependent—too willing to put a market value on human life—to give everyone the health care they need But the Republican Party expresses this antipathy to dependency in vicious ways and in all avenues of public life The GOP gets particularly vicious when dependency combines with race eugenics and racism are toxins that have always reinforced each other anyway If Sir Francis Galton stood before the GOP in 2017 and asked them what they mean by improvement they’d have ready answers To Steve Bannon it is a ban on Muslim refugees trying to enter this country To Jeff Sessions it is stricter voting laws that violate the rights of those who are most dependent on the government To Education Secretary Betsy DeVos it is an atrophied public school system and a weak Americans with Disabilities Act To Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price it is “highrisk insurance pools” for sick Americans To Vice President Mike Pence it is legalized discrimination against LGBT people And to Speaker Paul Ryan it is the destruction of the welfare state Republicans target weakness as energetically as eugenicists did They have embraced capitalism so fully that they will admit no flaw in it Confronted with inequality they tell us the problem lies not with the system but with the individual and his incurable deficiencies “We don’t want a dependency culture” Paul Ryan said in 2013 According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities Ryan’s “Better Way” budget would increase the wealth of America’s extreme upper class while prohibiting new funds for the Affordable Care Act and expanding work requirements for welfare recipients The implications—that the wealthy deserve to be even wealthier and that the poor are poor because they make bad personal choices—have been long reflected in Ryan’s personal views on the subject Ryan has since tried to distance himself from his old intellectual hero Ayn Rand  and from the Objectivist “makers and takers” rhetoric that made him a conservative star He has even generously conceded that  “Most people don’t want to be dependent” But there is no question that Ryan’s policies would exacerbate income inequality His welfare reform proposals build on former President Bill Clinton’s Personal Accountability and Work Opportunity Act and we now know that deep poverty nearly doubled after Clinton’s welfare policies were implemented Race and poverty and disability also intersect in a way that makes the eugenics comparison unavoidable People with disabilities are disproportionately more likely to live in poverty Lowincome students are disproportionately more likely to drop out of high school  And communities of color suffer the most According to a new Demos study  the racial wealth gap is so durable that nothing—not Ryan’s beloved twoparent households or college degrees or fulltime jobs—closes the gap between communities of color and whites The experiences of people of color provide the clearest proof that poverty is not a symptom of entitled dependency but of a corrupt system Republicans are dedicated to perpetuating that system Thus they cut welfare for the same reason eugenicists once sterilized the poor: Poor people drain resources better spent elsewhere Then there’s public education Trump and Betsy DeVos both champion the expansion of school vouchers and charter schools as a means to promote “school choice” for lowincome parents Vouchers which enable students to use public funding for the school of their choice are especially flawed since they disadvantage students with disabilities Private

Listen Irregularities in Swabi University: PTI government silent governor takes notice PESHAWAR: Despite the tall claims made by the PTI government large scale irregularities have been found in the University of Swabi after which Governor Iqbal Zafar Jhagra – also chancellor of the varsity – has directed his inspection team to launch an inquiry and submit its report within 15 days It is said that University of Swabi VC Dr Imtiaz Ali Khan resorted to illegal expanses established new departments and appointed 70 favourites without the syndicate’s approval On the complaint of the syndicate members the governor’s inspection team through a letter SOIII6206GS10 issued by the Governor’s Secretariat has been ordered to investigate the varsity affairs According to sources the syndicate members – Syed Akhtar Ali Shah and Dr Nasir Jamal – and the HEC representative – raised serious objections over the developments Documents show that the 70 people appointed in Grade1 to Grade 16 belonged to the same constituency and did not hold any exam for the purpose under Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency The VC launched a new department after acquiring tobacco market and also launched classes Many posts of professors associate professors assistant professors and lecturers as well as registrar and treasurer are vacant for a long period resulting in a decrease in the varsity’s rating But there was no advertisement for the appointments made by the VC which is an open violation of merit and the university’s rules An advertisement was published during the tenure of the previous VC for the posts of registrar deputy registrar assistant registrar and treasurer after which the candidates were shortlisted However none of them were ever called for interview Another complaint received by the governor is that of the changes in the required educational qualification and experience for allegedly appointing a university teacher as treasurer Meanwhile the registrar was removed after giving the additional charge to the treasurer Despite a clear policy given by the HEC no cell was set up to appoint the regular staff as the university is being run on the basis of adhocism and new department have been established amid paucity of funds Meanwhile the already functioning departments are still managed by lecturers and assistant professors The VC summoned a senate session without informing the syndicate members and later sent the copies of the decisions made at the meeting including the budget affairs in clear violation of the University Act 2002 and the General Finance Rules According to the documents the university’s syndicate in its 18th meeting had rejected all the recommendations of the VC concerning budget setting up new departments appointments and increasing the income sources The VC had proposed 100 per cent increase in budget when compared with that of 201516 and 201617 to which syndicate members – Nasir and Shah – as well as the HEC members raised objections They sought an explanation from the VC who argued that the increase in budget was required to set up new departments making appointments and increasing the income sources He said the HEC and the government had promised giving Rs 185 million and Rs 320 million to the university warning that the varsity would face a serious financial crisis in case of nonavailability of funds On the other hand all the efforts to reach the VC for his comments in this regard failed Efforts to contact him at his office number 09388490238 were made several times but his PA said he was very busy and therefore could not talk The VC was also contacted on his mobile and SMSs were also sent but he did not reply Meanwhile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Higher Education Secretary Syed Zafar Ali Shah when contacted said the VC under the University Act was bound to get approval from the syndicate and the governor in his capacity as the chancellor can order a probe in case of irregularities in the university However the provincial government too enjoys the same powers to launch an inquiry he added He said the provincial government would act in the light of the governor’s inspection team report

News story Robots compete in nuclear decommissioning challenge Robots controlled by smart autonavigation systems are doing battle in an £85 million competition to find ways to tackle Sellafield radioactivexa0hotspots Published 31 January 2018 Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and Innovate UK Robotics will be required to access the facilities An array of robots controlled by supersmart autonavigation systems are doing battle in an £85 million competition to develop new ways of tackling some of Sellafield’s most radioactive hotspots Last year the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority NDA and fellow government agency Innovate UK launched a search for innovative technologies that could be combined into a single seamless process for use in facilities that will soon embark on a major decommissioning journey Working closely with Sellafield Ltd who would use the technology submissions to a competitive process were invited from all industrial sectors Five promising ideas have now made it through to the final stages after being whittled down from a shortlist of 15 The newly formed consortia are each set to receive up to £15 million to build prototype demonstrators for testing in a simulated radioactive environment Conventional approaches to working in highhazard environments involve teams of workers clad in protective airfed suits who would be restricted to working no more than a few hours at a time  The process is extremely timeconsuming costly and poses risks to the workers The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant must be cleaned out and decommissioned The goal of Sellafield and the NDA is to reduce risks to workers increase productivity deal efficiently with waste reduce timescales and cut overall costs to the taxpayer:  safer faster cheaper This is complemented by the role of Innovate UK who are looking to drive productivity and growth in the UK through the support and implementation of innovation Announcing the projects the NDA’s Head of Technology Melanie Brownridge said the response from suppliers and academic institutions had been so promising that more funds were added to top up the original £3 million pot increasing it to £85 million: We were all incredibly excited by the quality and diversity of the submissions which came from established nuclear organisations as well as industries such as space and defence sectors working with us for the first time Such a fantastic response meant that we were able to secure additional funding from Innovate UK and the Government’s department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy BEIS which will allow more of the ideas to be fully explored and also investigated for potential use in other hazardous environments The projects demonstrate the full range of innovation – using existing ideas in an innovative way through to cuttingedge new technologies All the projects are being developed by collaborative consortia formed specifically for this competition  The participating organisations almost 30 in total include small businesses large corporations and academic institutions The winning project – or projects – could be  put to work at Sellafield’s Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant THORP and Magnox Reprocessing Plant which are both due to close by 2020    After closure scores of rooms or ‘cells’ at the facilities must be cleaned out with the waste safely treated for packing and storage Melanie added: It’s a huge challenge The new integrated system must establish what’s inside the cells measure the radioactivity access spaces that have been sealed for years cut up the contents including large vessels and many miles of pipework segregate the waste then remove it for treatment and safe storage  Radioactivity levels are extremely high restricting workforce access so the work must be carried out remotely A number of the technologies are tried and tested nuclear favourites some are well established in other industries others are brand new One of the challenges will be to develop a smooth interaction between all the different component parts Industries that have been keen to step up to the challenge include computer gaming fume extraction seafishing medical imaging oil and gas as well as space and defence Many ideas include robots which range from large industrial giants to small antlike devices that can work collectively and easily be replaced in the event of a breakdown One of the automapping systems was developed for use in missions to Mars and will be adapted to scan the interior of a radioactive cell The projects include technology developed for space missions to Mars Some projects will immerse operatives in a virtual world where they will intuitively be able to control robots and equipment as if they were actually inside the cells Melanie added: The NDA is continually seeking the best ways to encourage innovation and bring in new ideas from the supply chain and ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute Part of our mission is to support innovation and technology growth with the aim of pushing forward the decommissioning of extremely complex nuclear challenges Derek Allen Innovation Lead for Energy at Innovate UK said: We have been delighted by the response to this competition and the additional funding will enable us to support more innovative organisations with great ideas to make nuclear decommissioning cheaper safer and faster This has the potential to open up significant business opportunities for UK organisations both nationally and globally This programme fully aligns with one of the Governments Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund priority areas: ‘Robotics and artificial intelligence in extreme environments’ which is looking to create a safer working world for people improve productivity and support advances in industry and public services After the first series of trials set to take place over the next 18 months those with potential could progress to more rigorous trials in a radioactive environment  Approval from the nuclear regulators will be required before the integrated system can be deployed at Sellafield or other NDA sites Melanie added: We’re hopeful that a number may be successful and could be used in various different situations at our sites as well as in other hazardous scenarios both here and overseas More on the projects and how they are developing will be released over the next 12 months including articles from each consortium The five successful projects are lead contractor in bold: Barrnon Ltd Atkins Cambrian Intelligence Ltd Createc Ltd

No Comments Doidam 10  Shutterstockcom Alicia — whose identity is protected and therefore uses a pseudonym— was only 12 years old when she was married off raped and thereafter became a mother Now her husband and rapist has reportedly been granted custody of their two children The girl who comes from an immigrant family living in Gothenburg Sweden was made pregnant with twins by the man at the age of thirteen After a ruling by the Stockholm District Court the state has chosen to give the rapist custody Nightmare to childhood: The story was first brought to the light by the Gothenburg Post GP in June 2017 Back then Alicia who has turned 23yearsold chose to open up about her experiences and talk to social services When she turned seven social services first contacted her family when her teachers noticed bruises under her veil Alicia said her father had hit her Nevertheless the father denied this and when being questioned again Alicia herself changed the story “I was quiet As always I did everything for my family What girl would ever want to hurt her parents” Alicia said according to GP Her teachers kept an eye on her however and noticed a major change The girl once described as happy positive and tough grew increasingly absent and sad The year was about 2006 when the real nightmare started Alicia’s family brought her from her home in Gothenburg on a trip down to Iraq to be married away She still remembers the night clearly of her wedding She had to stand on a stool during the ceremony He was about 25yearsold “I did not really understand what happened I mostly walked around thinking of all the people and how beautiful everything was I felt a little like the girl from Beauty and the Beast” Alicia told GP “The worst came when all guests returned home and it became evening He wanted us to sleep in the same bed I said I wanted to sleep in my own bed I was terrified” she explained That night Alicia was severely raped by her ‘husband’ First she became pregnant and had a miscarriage The thirteenyearold pled for a divorce but both her husband and parents refused In 2007 she once again was made pregnant Realizing Sweden have better healthcare her parents brought her home without her husband In Gothenburg the girl who was still just a child became a mother When the social services received the news that Alicia had been missing from school and had given birth they started up a new investigation into the family The parents were prepared this time though Alicia had been raped by an unknown stranger during their vacation in Iraq they told the social services who subsequently ended the investigation claiming there was “no problems” in the family When the girl was 15 her family returned to Iraq “My husband demanded he should be given custody He threatened my dad with sending the wedding photos to Swedish authorities if he did not get his will through” she said Fortunately after a discussion in the family they granted her a divorce but also him custody of her children Alicia as a female with a divorce behind her became seen as a disgrace to the family She was not allowed to go to school or go out alone This remained unchanged until she received the news that she could marry one of her father’s friend’s sons This marriage too ended in divorce “I am not going to be quiet any longer:” In mid2017 23yearold Alicia chose to speak out about her experiences She had not been in contact with her family since she discarded her veil and was disowned In coming out with her story she sought answers on why the social services did not do more and on if she can get in contact with her children again “My whole body is shrieking:” Now as GP writes about half a year later Stockholm’s District Court has chosen to give the rapist exhusband who is seeking asylum in Sweden the right of custody of their children under the pretext that they have spent most of their lives with him in Iraq In response to the decision experts have called the ruling a “shame to Swedish authorities” according to GP Juno Blom a government expert at the county administrative board of Östergötland said: “My whole body is shrieking All of this girl’s life has been nothing more than a betrayal by our society A little girl has been taken out of Sweden married away been raped and lost her children without the authorities acting And now they put the last nail in the coffin by taking away her right to custody I have never seen a case when so many wrongdoings have been done” “I have worked with this question for many years but this case is the absolute sickest thing I’ve heard in my life You don’t a college education in honorrelated violence to understand that this is horribly wrong”Sara Mohammad who works for GAPF  an organization working to prevent honor violence reacted strongly: “I am truly upset This girl has been a commodity in several people’s hands … You must use completely different glasses when examining honor violence otherwise we will sacrifice more lives completely legally Our society has to take a stand In my opinion are you not a suitable parent if you have married and had sex with a child”

OC Weighs Marijuana Options Considers Community Values By Bill Barlow Save OCEAN CITY – The city’s attorney is looking at options for the community should New Jersey legalize the recreational use of marijuanaxa0 State Sen Nicholas Scutari D22nd introduced legislation at the start of this year’s session that would legalize the sale and use of the drug along similar lines to what takes place in Colorado Gov Phil Murphy is a supporter and indicated he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk On Jan 12 Democrat Murphy replaced Republican Gov Chris Christie who opposed any move toward legalization At the Jan 25 City Council meeting members of Ocean City’s governing body made clear they were not in favor Councilman Michael DeVlieger raised the issue as part of the discussion at the end of the meeting He asked Mayor Jay Gillian what could be done to keep marijuana out of Ocean City DeVlieger cited a letter from the substance abuse treatment and prevention agency Cape Assist in raising the topic at the meeting “It’s a topic for more than just a little report here It runs deep in the effect it will have on the state as a whole I’m more concerned about our community right here” he said “But I think it’s something we need to get in the public conversation and make some decisions before it’s made at the state level” Gillian responded that he’s already asked city attorney Dottie McCrosson to investigate the issue In an apparent reference to medical marijuana Gillian said “If it helps kids I’m for it” but he spoke against legalizing the drug for recreational sale and use Gillian indicated that he has heard from some in law enforcement that Colorado has seen an increase in homelessness and traffic fatalities since legalizing He said the cost of the damage from legal weed would outweigh any benefit “If it brings a billion dollars in it’s going to cost the taxpayers $2 billion in damage” he said Others on council also expressed concerns about the potential impact of legalization Keith Hartzell cited Ocean City’s voters stance on alcohol sales as a likely indication of how theyd feel about marijuana He also mentioned the town’s image as a familyfriendly resort “I’ve got to think the majority of the community will not welcome it at all Nor will our visitors” he saidxa0 Councilwoman Karen Bergen expressed concern about people smoking pot in public “I mean they can’t be smoking it on the boardwalk” she asked “You have legislated nosmoking areas for cigarettes in town I’m confident that you’re going to be able to do something similar with this” McCrosson said Members of the administration stated that there is no smoking allowed on the boardwalk Councilman Bobby Barr made his opposition to legalization clear “I think the whole marijuana thing is silly” he said “All of the problems here in the State of New Jersey and that’s one of the first things we’re going to tackle is marijuana I just think it’s stupid “I would support anything that we could do to prevent that from happening here” he continued McCrosson indicated that municipalities would likely be able to keep dispensaries out “The current draft of the bill allows municipalities to decide whether they will permit the sale of marijuana” she told the council “We don’t know what the final bill is going to be but every draft that I’ve seen is going to allow the individual municipality to make a decision” “This is going to be a tough one” Gillian said indicating that he wants to hear from residents on the issue During the discussion he said he would speak for the other side “because we are in America” He said a town could not take away individual rights and brought up the impact of alcohol “I don’t drink and it’s very difficult for me how it’s affected my family But you have to understand that if something is legal and people can do it you can’t take away people’s rights” he said We have to educate ourselves and we have to be fair Alcohol is legal and look what it does to people” Under the current bill towns that opt out of allowing sales do not get a share of the revenue “The money made on this is going to be huge They think it’s going to lower property taxes” Gillian said “I don’t think so I think its going to be very dangerous and you need to talk to some of these other states” DeVlieger suggested that Murphy would spend that additional revenue “He’s going to need all of that for what he’s talking about giving away” he said in an apparent reference to the governor’s spending plans More than half of the states – including New Jersey – have made allowances for the medical use of marijuana despite federal laws saying it cannot be used or prescribed An increasing number of states have also decided to allow possession sale and use of the drug for those over 21 most by popular vote This month Vermont became the latest state to join the trend with a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts and Maine set to take effect Under President Obama a policy essentially kept federal law enforcement from taking action in states that have legalized marijuana President Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ended that policy and has indicated a harder line on medical and recreational marijuana could be on the way from Washington In New Jersey Scutari’s bill would allow those over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and set up a system for statelicensed dispensaries to sell heavily taxed marijuana or potinfused edibles The bill would also establish a state Division of Marijuana Enforcement Its next step will be before the Senate Judiciary Committee If the committee gives its OK the bill then heads to the Senate floor for a vote Early indications during the campaign were that the Democratic majority would fasttrack the matter although some observers say it may not come for a vote until later this year at the earliest Some Democrats including Sen Jeff Van Drew say they would oppose full legalization Scutari could not be contacted for this story In published comments he has cited Colorado’s success in legalization where weed is a billiondollar industry and has meant a big boost in state revenues Polls indicate legalization remains popular in Colorado the first state to allow sales to adultsxa0 He and other proponents say legalization takes illicit profits away from gangs and cartels and that the current laws unfairly impact African Americans “Black New Jerseyans are nearly three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white New Jerseyans despite similar usage rates” Scutari’s bill reads It also asserts that the state spends about $127 million a year on marijuana enforcement and that three out of five drug arrests in the state are for marijuana According to the bill 24000 people were arrested for marijuana possession in 2012 Gillian plans to bring a proposal to the city council potentially banning marijuana sales in the municipality Some shore towns have already taken similar steps and others are looking at options “We’ll bring something forward and our constituents will tell us what they think” Gillian said “It’s not going to be the golden egg The detriment it’s

On Wednesday 24 January an international body reported that the UK government had breached the legal human rights of sick and disabled people This is now the fifth such report to state this in just 20 months The ECSR A report pdf “ECSR conclusions for 2017 – UK” xa0from thexa0 European Committee of Social Rights part of the Council of Europe  details whether the UK government was meeting its legal obligations under the European Social Charter xa0The UK signed up to the charter in July 1996 pdf p3  It covers “ fundamental ” human rights including those related to employment housing health education social protection and welfare The reportxa0 covered pdf p3 xa0the years 2012 to 2015 And overall it found the UK government was breaching its legal obligations in two areas Failing on welfare The first breach was of Article 12 the right to social security The committeexa0 found pdf pp1922 that many welfare benefits – including Employment and Support Allowance ESA and Jobseeker’s Allowance JSA – were “manifestly inadequate” That is people were not getting enough money to live on and were being left in poverty The committee made a point pdf p19 of noting that in response to a previous report where it had raised this issue the UK government: contests this finding… arguing that the benefit rates are considered in isolation without taking into account the safety net of other benefits and credits available But the committee once again disagreed It said pdf p20 that all the benefitsxa0mentioned left people below the poverty line even with “other benefits and credits” Therefore this is an automatic breach of the charter pdf p20  ‘Hunger’ ‘Maladministration’ Going further the committee noted some serious concerns over the Department for Work and Pensions’ DWP benefit sanctions regime It referenced a report given to axa0 UN committee xa0which highlighted that pdf 2324 : “The postrecession rise in UK hunger is intimately connected to the rise in benefit delays caused by an increase in both benefit sanctioning as well as maladministration” “The high percentage of successful appeals against welfare benefit decisions sanctions provides further confirmation of the prevalence of poor administration” It said pdf p24 that the UK government must “urgently” reform “the benefit sanctions scheme” and take steps “to reduce benefit delay” And the committee warned pdf p24 that if in the next report the UK government did not show how it is doing this: There will be nothing to establish that there is an effective right to social assistance for all persons in need The committee also pdf p2527 “deferred its conclusion” on whether the UK government was meeting its legal obligations to EU nationals and asylum seekers and refugees stating it: cannot accept the necessity of halting the provision of such basic emergency assistance as shelter… to individuals in a highly precarious situation Failing on workers’ rights And an NHS in crisis The second area that the committee stated the UK government was breaching legal obligations was Article 3 This covers the right to safe and healthy working conditions It concluded that the UK did not conform to the treaty in its protection of temporary domestic and selfemployed workers pdf p67  It also noted discrepancies between the number of UK workrelated deaths and nonfatal injuries that the government reported and the EU’s figures the EU’s being higher Also of note were the committee’s conclusions over Article 11 the right to protection of health It said that: The UK government missed pdf p13 its own NHS targets on “four hour accident and emergency waits 18 weeks from referraltotreatment 62 days to start of cancer treatment and six weeks for diagnostic tests” Rates pdf p14 of mental health issues were “higher” for poor ethnic minorities and an “issue of concern” for the LGBTQ+ community Alcohol consumption and abuse levels had “risen” over the long term pdf p1718  The committee only found one positive development pdf p3 since its previous report That was thexa0Control of Asbestos Regulations which came into force in 2012 The DWP says… A DWP spokespersonxa0 told xa0The Guardian: Our welfare system is among the best in the world and we are committed to helping people improve their lives We spend over £90bn a year supporting people of working age including those who are out of work or on a low income The UK government must now report back to the ECSR on all these areas But we’ve been here before Disabled people: living on the edge The UN has publishedxa0 four xa0 reports xa0 since June 2016xa0 into xa0the Conservative government All of them condemned its treatment of sick and disabled people saying it hadxa0 committed xa0“grave” and “systematic” violations of their human rights One UN committee went even further stating xa0that the UK government has created a “human catastrophe” for disabled people and then tried to misrepresent the impact of its policies through “unanswered questions” “misused statistics” and a “smoke screen of statements” So now we have this fifth report by a European committee As one disabled person told

Order Reprint of this Story January 30 2018 11:09 AM Kansas’ prisons hospitals and other state facilities are in disrepair after years of underfunding according to the man who has spent the last seven years as the state’s governor Gov Sam Brownback who will officially step down as governor Wednesday  sounded off about the condition of state buildings last week after the State Finance Council approved a 20year $360 million building project at Lansing Correctional Facility “Getting this new prison built is a big deal” Brownback told reporters “We’ve got a series of state assets that have been underfunded for years I’ve been asking some of you guys to go around and look at some of them whether it’s Lansing or Osawatomie State Hospital” The state’s psychiatric facility in Osawatomie just regained its federal Medicare certification last month after a nearly twoyear process that required the state to make a slew of updates Never miss a local story Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access SUBSCRIBE NOW “It’s a pit isn’t it” Brownback said of the hospital “Parsons State Hospital is worse than Osawatomie And so you’ve got these state assets that we haven’t put any money into for years” Brownback’s candor about the poor condition of state facilities and their underfunding came minutes after the first of two votes by the US Senate to approve his nomination for ambassador atlarge for international religious freedom  Basking in the dual triumphs of the prison project’s approval and his impending ambassadorship Brownback pushed back on the suggestion that as the state’s governor since 2011 he had responsibility for the underfunding of state hospitals and prisons “For 155 years No” Brownback said Pressed again on the fact that he had been governor for seven years Brownback replied “And we got a new prison didn’t we” Lawmakers and state workers were mystified by Brownback’s suggestion that he was not responsible for the condition of state buildings after nearly two full terms as governor “Every leader says the buck stops with them So he’s obviously responsible for it because he’s been governor for the last seven years … and he obviously let those facilities deteriorate” said Robert Choromanski the executive director of the Kansas Organization of State Employees the union that represents state workers “I think it’s sad that he has let those facilities crumble to such a state of disrepair He is the leader of the state of Kansas until the 31st so he should take responsibility for it” Lt Gov Jeff Colyer who takes the oath of office Wednesday afternoon  issued a statement through his spokesman that he “believes that it is time to make smart investments in our infrastructure” “But like most things it matters more how you spend the money than the total dollars spent” said Kendall Marr a spokesman for Colyer State Sen Laura Kelly a Topeka Democrat running for governor called Brownback’s comments “insulting to our staff who work in those facilities … under some dire conditions” Choromanski said the poor conditions have hurt recruitment efforts at state hospitals and other institutions contributing to understaffing  “No one wants to work at a decrepit facility” he said One employee at Osawatomie who spoke on condition of anonymity recalled discovering that an animal was living in the same building as patients three years ago “Judging by the droppings it was larger than a raccoon” the worker said The worker who has been at the facility for most of Brownback’s tenure as governor blamed the governor for the conditions “It’s his fault We’d ask for things to be fixed like the roof leaking and we’d be told there’s no point It’s just going to leak somewhere else” the worker said “… I know a lot of people are concerned for their safety just off of the disrepair” Kelly and others repeatedly pointed to Brownback’s tax cuts which the Legislature rescinded last year in the face of a budget hole as the reason the state could not keep up facilities State Sen Carolyn McGinn a Sedgwick Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee noted that Brownback’s budget recommendations for the state hospitals for both the current and previous budget years was tens of millions of dollars less than the hospitals had requested “We need to look at repairing what will last for the next 50 years tear down what won’t and invest in new facilities if needed” McGinn said in an email Osawatomie’s campus includes multiple dilapidated buildings  some of which have been empty since the 1990s that have been left in disrepair because razing them would be too expensive and rehabilitating them would cost even more Some of the state’s whitecollar workers are also operating out of facilities that need improvements A June review of state office buildings in Topeka rated as deficient the buildings that house the Kansas Department of Education the Kansas Supreme Court and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment Candidates for governor from both parties said the next administration needs to take the management of state facilities more seriously “We don’t have the money to take care of the assets that people of Kansas have entrusted us with and that’s sad” said former state Rep Mark Hutton a Wichita Republican who is running for governor Hutton who made his personal fortune in the construction business said that investing more money in preventive maintenance will save the state money in the long term “You either take care of your car today or you’re walking tomorrow” he said Hutton said that when the state approves a new building project it needs to also set aside money to perform maintenance in future years something that is increasingly done by universities when funding expansion projects but is still rare for most state projects Hutton said that it’s not politically popular to spend money on prisons and psychiatric hospital which leads to their needs being overlooked He called their decline a public safety issue “If these people could vote I wonder if they’d get more attention” Hutton said The Lansing project had generated controversy both because it’ll be constructed through a leasepurchase agreement instead of a bond offering a move that some state workers fear is a step toward privatization and because of the ties that lobbyists for the project had to Brownback But even many of the project’s critics acknowledge the need for improvements at the prison Corrections Secretary Joe Norwood led lawmakers on a tour of Lansing last spring showcasing the rust and increasingly dangerous deterioration of the 75yearold building that houses the cafeteria “If we can’t feed them we can’t house them” Mike Gaito director of capital of improvements for the Department of Corrections told lawmakers at the time House Minority Leader Jim Ward a Wichita Democrat running for governor said there’s almost a “universal consensus” that Lansing needs improvements Ward said that he voted against the project last week because it should have been brought before the full Legislature for more thorough vetting rather than the State Finance Council a panel that includes the governor and legislative leaders He said that the state hospital in Osawatomie needed improvements before Brownback took office “What he did is accelerate the deterioration” Ward said contending that Brownback’s tax cuts made it impossible to address the facility’s needs “I totally reject his arguments that’s he’s not responsible for his seven years” said Ward who promised to create a 10year facilities plan as governor The same week that Brownback called Osawatomie a pit Colyer celebrated on Twitter that the state’s psychiatric facility in Larned would not lose its federal certification despite federal investigators finding deficiencies during an inspection last year “If you’re in the ColyerBrownback administration that’s as high as the bar gets” Ward said Choromanski said that at some point a governor will have to grapple with the declining conditions at state facilities “I think it’s going to have to finally stop because it’s at the breaking point” he said

Pinterest Contractors of new airports can be assured of the landing and parking fees they levy after the government made the call to fix the rates before inviting bids The decision would pave the way for potential entry of foreign investment as it removes regulatory uncertainty from the equation This usually deterred investors from vying for airport projects in the country says aviation industry analysts Airline executives also lauded the decision saying that they would have more visibility on a key recurring cost At the moment the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority AERA has the authority to decide on the fees at privately run airports Airport operators and airlines have often bemoaned about tariffs In fact on one occasion the Supreme Court had to step in to implement a rate revision “We have the approval from the Union Cabinet to amend the AERA Act which will allow us to decide charges prior to the bidding of the airport project” said a senior aviation ministry official who asked for anonymity The Ministry is still developing the procedures to fix the fees during the prebid stage he added The official explained that AERA would continue to decide tariffs at airports that are in operation or where the projects have already been awarded New airports at Jewar in Greater Noida and Pune would most likely be among the first to be bid out under the proposal The decision is expected to make the airport sector even more attractive to foreign investors explained Satyan Nayar the SecretaryGeneral of the Association of Private Airport Operators Foreign investors often see regulatory uncertainty as the biggest roadblock in the Indian market he said saying: “Fixing tariff prior to bids would take care of regulatory uncertainty and help give a boost to foreign investments in the airports sector in India” An estimated $45 billion is said to be needed to develop airport infrastructure in the country Nayar claimed “A substantial percentage of this will come through foreign investments” he said Carriers remarked that bidding for airports on tariffs would provide relief for both passengers and airlines “This would be a good move as it would bring respite from sudden increase in charges at private airports However the government should ensure that the charges keep falling every year” said an airline representative who asked not to be named Share

Stanistreet general secretary of the National Union of Journalists who is giving evidence alongside Gracie told the commitee that the language used by the BBC was missing the point of the issue She said: What has been really frustrating the language of the BBC  and it’s obviously a deliberate thing because it’s from a lot of executives at a lot of different times  they keep talking about fair pay rather than equal pay They have said they believe fair pay is a higher bench mark than equal pay and it kind of misses the point about what a lot of this debate is about I think it’s also frustrating that the language of how they are reacting partly maybe a bunker mentality or too many lawyers involved behind the scenes but the use of the language is making the problem worse They are referring to inadvertent errors of underpaying people or talking about no evidence decisions were taken to wilfully discriminate They are weasel words and the reality they have instead of trying to come up with excuses and make the situation look better they should just hold their hands up and say ‘yes there has been a problem some of which I inherited but this is how we are going to sort it out

@CommonsCMS select committee Thank you Carrie for speaking so clearly about pay injustice Will spur change not just @BBC but for all women at work From the Times columnist Jenni Russell Jenni Russell @jennirsl Fantastic storming appearance by @BBCCarrie at DCMS Ctee Has refused backpay from BBC as they still won’t commit to giving her equal pay with the men They now claim in her 1st 3 yrs as China editor she was ‘in development’  09:41 Gracie says she was expected to spend 200 days a year in China  She says when she was given the job she was told the Europe editor and the North America editor were on about £120000 She said she would have to put her son into a state boarding school costing £10000 a year So her pay was made up to £130000 I thought that I was effectively getting equal pay at that point In my grievance outcome it says that Fran Unsworth then head of newsgathering does not recollect the conversation the same way I do or words to that effect I’m puzzled by that because when I had a pay negotiation with the current head of news gathering Jonathan Munro last year in October that was my first pay negotiation I said this to him and he said and I quote exactly his words ‘Fran remembers the conversation as you do’ Updated Carrie Gracie describes BBC claim she was paid less because she was in development as insult Gracie says the BBC want to pay her nearly £100000 in back pay I’m not an employment lawyer but it sounds to me like a tacit admission that it is pay discrimination in that they want to pay me now nearly £100000 in back pay The thing that is very unacceptable to me is they have basically said in the previous years 2014 2015 2016 I was in development It is an insult to add to the original injury It is unacceptable to talk to your senior women like that I would have never agreed to China on those terms I was for four years leading our China coverage there are significant risks in our China coverage I dealt with them I did a good job She says when given the job she was told she was in charge Carrie Gracie describes BBC claim she was paid less because she was “in development” as “an insult” I’m getting emotional but the thing is what I really want to say about the equal pay problem at the BBC is that it forced the BBC to retrofit justifications of the indispensable It’s not acceptable to say that because you have an equal pay problem but you can’t admit it because you don’t want to confront what may be fiscal liabilities which we all agree they are there I am not a fiscal liability I have said I don’t want any more money They are trying to throw money at me to resolve the problem this will not resolve my problem My problem will be resolved by an acknowledgement my work was of equal value to the men I served alongside Updated 
Politics This Leaked Government Brexit Analysis Says The UK Will Be Worse Off In Every Scenario Exclusive: BuzzFeed News has seen a new Brexit impact assessment which says leaving the EU will adversely hit almost every sector and every UK region Posted on Pin David Davis and Theresa May The governments new analysis of the impact of Brexit says the UK would be worse off outside the European Union under every scenario modelled BuzzFeed News can reveal The assessment which is titled “EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing” and dated January 2018 looked at three of the most plausible Brexit scenarios based on existing EU arrangements Under a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU UK growth would be 5% lower over the next 15 years compared to current forecasts according to the analysis The no deal scenario which would see the UK revert to World Trade Organization WTO rules would reduce growth by 8% over that period The softest Brexit option of continued singlemarket access through membership of the European Economic Area would in the longer term still lower growth by 2% These calculations do not take into account any shortterm hits to the economy from Brexit such as the cost of adjusting the economy to new customs arrangements Pin The cover title of the new analysis The assessment seen by BuzzFeed News is being kept tightly guarded inside government It was prepared by officials across Whitehall for the Department for Exiting the European Union DExEU and is reportedly being presented to key ministers in onetoone meetings this week ahead of discussion at the Brexit cabinet subcommittee next week Asked why the prime minister was not making the analysis public a DExEU source told BuzzFeed News: Because its embarrassing Even though the analysis assumes that the UK will agree a trade deal with the US roll over dozens of the EU’s current trade agreements and consider loosening regulations after Brexit there is no scenario that does not leave the country worse off Officials believe the methodology for the new assessment is better than that used for similar analyses before the referendum The January 2018 analysis looked only at existing EU arrangements which means bespoke arrangements have yet to be modelled Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she is seeking a deep and special partnership with the EU The other main findings of the analysis: • Almost every sector of the economy included in the analysis would be negatively impacted in all three scenarios with chemicals clothing manufacturing food and drink and cars and retail the hardest hit The analysis found that only the agriculture sector under the WTO scenario would not be adversely affected • Every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios with the North East the West Midlands and Northern Ireland before even considering the possibility of a hard border facing the biggest falls in economic performance • There is a risk that London’s status as a financial centre could be severely eroded with the possibilities available under an FTA not much different to those in the WTO option • On the plus side the analysis assumes in all scenarios that a trade deal with the US will be concluded and that it would benefit GDP by about 02% in the long term Trade deals with other nonEU countries and blocs such as China India Australia the Gulf countries and the nations of Southeast Asia would add in total a further 01% to 04% to GDP over the long term Pin Britains Secretary of State for Exiting the EU David Davis Theresa May European Commission President JeanClaude Juncker and EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in December 2017 in Brussels The government has found itself in repeated difficulty over the existence – or lack – of Brexit impact studies Last year the Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that dozens had been carried out “in excruciating detail” but after a Commons vote forced the publication of these assessments he told MPs he had been misunderstood and they did not exist after all DExEU published a series of broad sectoral analyses instead The biggest negative impact comes from the UK’s decision to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market – the issue at the heart of the Conservative Party’s ongoing internal strife over Brexit Leaving these arrangements creates what the analysis calls “nontariff barriers” to trade such as loss of market access in certain sectors and new customs and border checks and practices Some of these can be minimised if Britain were to remain in the single market via the EEA and the impact can also be partly offset through domestic policy or trade deals with the US and others but the losses cannot be eliminated altogether once the UK is outside the customs union This new analysis suggests that there could be opportunity for the UK in agreeing trade deals with nonEU countries and deregulating in areas such as the environment product standards and employment law However the analysis also casts doubt on the idea that these benefits would be enough to mitigate the losses to the economy caused by leaving the single market and customs union Moving away from the existing set of rules and standards would also make it harder to trade with the EU in the future and would be politically controversial domestically This specific debate risks deepening the conflict inside the Tory party between those such as chancellor Philip Hammond who want to remain more closely aligned to the EU for years and the hardline Brexiteers led by backbencher Jacob ReesMogg A government spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: “We have already set out that the government is undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis in support of our EU exit negotiations and preparations We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work and that ministers have a duty not to publish anything that could risk exposing our negotiation position” A government source said: “As part of its preparations for leaving the European Union officials from across Whitehall are undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis An early draft of this next stage of analysis has looked at different offtheshelf arrangements that currently exist as well as other external estimates It does not however set out or measure the details of our desired outcome – a new deep and special partnership with the EU – or predict the conclusions of the negotiations It also contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependent on a wide range of assumptions which demonstrate that significantly more work needs to be carried out to make use of this analysis and draw out conclusions” Alberto Nardelli is Europe editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in London Contact Alberto Nardelli at albertonardelli@buzzfeedcom

Posted By: Uploader ISLAMABAD Jan 31 APP:Minister of State for Information Broadcasting National History and Literary Heritage Wednesday said that Imran should not blame the federal government for his failures as throwing the rubble of his failures on others would not help in saving him from accountability of the masses In a statement issued here today the minister asked Imran to reveal what happened to the 350 Dams and on which planet they were being built She said that the Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak talked something else in the Council of Common Interest meetings and told entirely the different story while sitting with Imran She said that the entire nation knew that Pakistan TehrikiInsaf had failed miserably to serve the people of KPK The minister said that no amount of lies could endear him well to the people of Pakistan as they had seen his true face Marriyum said that Imran had done nothing during the last four years except embellishing the container puppet shows lies and denigrating constitutional state institutions The minister said that when Imran was preparing containers the federal and Punjab governments were busy in setting up power projects which were nearing completion adding that instead of being jealous of Shahbaz Sharif he should adopt the habit of working hard and creating in him the spirit to serve the people She said that electricity was produced through installation of power projects and not through signing of MOUs only Marriyum said that instead of producing electricity Imran encouraged theft of the electricity supplied to KPK The minister challenged Imran Khan to name a single project that PTI government initiated and completed as well Post navigation

President Hage Geingob is expected back in Windhoek this lunch hour after flying commercial to Addis Ababa for the African Union Summit a costcutting measure State House saidxa0 xa0 PRESIDENT Hage Gottfried Geingob Compounded with recent reports of the security of the State now being compromised by the armed forces going on forced leave it is high time government comes out clean that we are in an economic crisis Crippling economic conditions is perhaps one of the main reasons Namibia was not for the first time represented at the World Economic Forum’s biggest annual gathering in Davos Switzerland where other neighbouring countries sent delegations of up to 40 experts And for a country that went on an investmentmarketing overdrive in the USA as well as hosting an Investment Summit Namibia’s absence at Davos leaves more questions than answers on the true state of our economy Time politicians cut salaries instead of sending our soldiers homexa0 This week President Hage Geingob issued to directive that affects all travel outside the borders of Namibia Said State House today “This directive is specifically in the interest of curtailing public expenditure no request for outbound travel by Ministers Deputy Ministers and other Political Office Bearers will be considered until after the end of February 2018” Is there something the politicians are not really telling us besides the obvious realisation that there is no money Well there is according to the signs of the times But with the government wage bill now at 49% of all noninterest expenditure why is government not cutting on increased public expenditurexa0 Namibian government operational expenditure accounts for 85% of total expenditure while the public wage bill represents 88% of operational expenditure for the financial year 201617 Cutting expenditure has reached its optimal level as additional spending cuts would result in political social and economic risks economist Purvance Heuer warned last year He warned of emerging risks such as late salary payments by some SOEs and the delays in payments of medical aid premiums for some public servants all which has come true With about 50% of total revenue is committed to the wage bill N$28 billion in 201617 financial year out of a total budget of N$62 billion perhaps it is high time politicians take pay cuts So far only President Hage Geingob has donated 30% of if N$146 000 monthly salary to charity but that’s a drop in the ocean where our security is now compromised and he has to fly commercial Besides their salaries Namibian Minister get a hefty N$222000 annual housing allowance and N$55000 per month water &amp electricity subsidy Investigative reporter John Grober says members of the National Assembly are paid the same as members of the National Council it is also not clear if Ministers who are members of the National Assembly also draw an extra salary as MPs Below are the salaries of Namibian political leaders And if only they

Published January 30 2018 Updated January 30 2018 Significant changes the government announced this week to tackle a growing deficit of more than $1billion at British Columbias public autoinsurance provider will not be enough to stanch the bleeding says Joy MacPhail the chair of the Insurance Corporation of BC In nine months the anticipated deficit increased by a factor of 10 thanks to spiralling claims costs that show no signs of slowing Ms MacPhails comments in an interview with The Globe and Mail suggest more reforms are coming possibly including caps on injury payouts and higher premiums Ms MacPhail said the rising costs of settling claims have been emerging since 2014 However she said the deficit forecast in last years budget has veered so dramatically off course because of trends related to the slow pace of settling litigation in BCs uniqueinCanada fulltort system in which those who are injured can sue for all damages in court without a legislated cap on payments Story continues below advertisement AttorneyGeneral David Eby on Monday announced changes he expects to introduce in the spring including a cap on minor injury claims and higher premiums for bad drivers He said without these measures the average BC driver would face a $400 rate hike next year to restore ICBC to balance The NDP promised in last years election campaign to freeze ICBC rates but they were increased by 64 per cent on basic insurance in November This week Mr Eby refused to rule out additional rate hikes Ms MacPhail said in the interview Mr Ebys proposals will reduce the need for additional rate hikes but she also did not rule them out The proposed changes the government is talking about will go a long way to solving the problem thats why it is so perplexing to me that these changes were not brought in earlier she said on Tuesday However its not the resolution to all the problems Mr Eby has slammed the Liberal government for not taking measures to curb ICBCs costs British Columbia drivers who pay some of the highest autoinsurance premiums in the country are not paying nearly enough to cover the cost of claims today As a result ICBCs deficit this year is projected to hit $13billion up from the $115million that was forecast at the start of the fiscal year The shift is almost entirely due to higher claims costs – ICBC paid $3billion to settle claims last year and in the first nine months of this fiscal year has paid $425billion Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement In 2013 the BC Liberal government introduced a rate smoothing policy that capped ICBCs annual increases Since then rates have climbed by about 55 per cent each year but ICBCs costs have climbed faster In 2017 ICBC would have needed an increase of 20 per cent to keep up with costs and the insurer is projected to require a 30percent increase next year to balance its books Ms MacPhail who was appointed chair by the NDP government last July said auto insurance claims have been rising across North America for at least three years and changes to rein in costs are overdue here The insurance product has been changed virtually everywhere in North America because of these trends everyone is facing she said When the NDP formed government last summer Mr Eby received in his transition package a detailed study from Ernst & Young warning of significant structural problems at ICBC The consultants report provided four options to reduce costs The most dramatic would be moving to a comprehensivecare model – the socalled no fault option the NDP and the Liberals rejected But the Ernst & Young report also suggested that imposing a cap on minor injury claims – similar to the systems in Alberta and New Brunswick – could dramatically reduce costs A cap of $7000 to $9000 on painandsuffering settlements for minor injuries even after doubling the accidentbenefits allowance and medicalpayments limit – would save ICBC about $770million The report noted that claims costs for minor injuries have been climbing since 2000 and in 2016 accounted for 60 per cent of total bodily injury claims paid by ICBC Story continues below advertisement But Ms MacPhail said two new trends emerged this year that contributed to the ballooning deficit Many older claims that were initially assessed as minor are now heading to court as largeloss claims of more than $200000 Over the past year the cost of settling largeloss claims has increased by 80 per cent As well she said the cases in which claimants are represented by lawyers are taking longer to settle The BC Liberals began 20162017 projecting an $11million loss at ICBC but the Crown corporation finished the fiscal year with a loss of more than $900million budget documents say Follow Justine Hunter on Twitter @justine_hunter

Q: When is a digraph not a digraph A: When it crosses a syllable boundary A digraph is two letters that combine to correspond to one sound phoneme Examples of consonant digraphs are ‘ch sh th ng’ The phoneme ng is initially taught as corresponding to the digraph ‘ng’ in words such as ‘bang sang king ring wing long song string going looking’ But how do children identify digraphs and their corresponding phonemes when they are seen in other words like bingo mango bongo fungus fungal angle triangle angry hungry kangaroo ingot angel language Do they try to say the same sound as in bang wing It turns out that if the word has more than one syllable and the ‘ng’ spelling is at the syllable boundary then ‘n’ is in one syllable and ‘g’ is in the other syllable mango bingo bongo fungus fungal angle triangle angry hungry kangaroo ingot angel language So the consecutive letters do not represent the single phoneme ng If we consider some common vowel digraphs and look at words containing them we see the same thing happens in these written words also The vowel digraphs ‘oa ea oe ie ue’ can be seen in the words ‘road eat toe pie blue’ However the multisyllable words ‘oasis create poet diet duet’ pronounced ‘oasis create poet diet duet also contain the same letters in the same order In these words the letters do not form a digraph to represent a single phoneme The digraphs ‘ar er ir or ur’ can be seen in the words ‘farm herd girl fork burn’ and the same letters in the same order can be seen in the two syllable words ‘garage very pirate orange bury’ These words are split into syllables as follows garage very pirate orange bury’ where the vowel is in the first syllable and the ‘r’ in the second Here the consecutive letters do not form a digraph either ** There are split digraphs ‘ae ee ie oe’ occurring in words like ‘cave these like home’ These same letter combinations can be seen in the two syllable words ‘camel panel seven given rivet honest oven’ The letters ‘a e i o’ are pronounced as short vowels in the first syllable and the letter ‘e’ is pronounced in the second syllable as follows ‘camel panel seven given rivet honest oven’ Then there are the digraphs ‘oo oi aw ew ow sh’ in the words ‘moon boil saw new down ship’ The same consecutive letter combinations occur in the multisyllable words ‘cooperate going aware reward towards mishap’ but they do not represent single phonemes in these words  It is the syllable structure of the word that determines how the consecutive letters are pronounced For children who have been taught to recognise digraphs as spelling of phonemes what do they say when they see consecutive letters in multisyllabic words where the letters do not represent digraphs of single phonemes Children are taught about digraphs in phonics lessons in the Reception Year and Year 1 aged 4 5 and 6 in schools in England There is an appendix of these digraphs in the National Curriculum to be taught as specific spellings of words in Year 1 There is a phonics screening check at the end of Year 1 to make sure that children know them The digraphs in the check include ‘ai ay ae ee ea ee ie ie oa oe oo ue ew ue ou ow ar er ir or ur oi oy sh ch th ng’ Children will have spent many hours in these phonics lessons being trained to recognise these spellings and convert them into single sounds Then they will see them in words containing two syllables and the way in which they are pronounced is different Are children also taught to look for syllables as a means of identifying digraphs Can they separate digraphs from single letter sounds in this manner How are children supposed to know these differences if the only strategy they are taught to use when decoding words is the single cuing strategy of sound only This single cuing is described as the left to right recognition of graphemes which are then to be pronounced as phonemes and then these are to be blended together to form words Hopefully at this stage the blended sound triggers knowledge of a known word that children are able to pronounce Then they will have ‘decoded’ it When children are reading continuous text there are cues other than sound available to help them pronounce words These cues include taking note of the structure of the sentence the order of the words or whether they are nouns verbs or joining words the meaning generated prior to meeting the unknown word semantics and pictures as illustrations These are all cues that children can use to ‘decode’ decipher pronounce unfamiliar written words which they may already know But the UK government expects children not to use these other cues in the synthetic phonic criteria applied to the Reception Year and Year 1 Their model of reading The Simple View separates decoding from any knowledge of spoken language The phonic screening check uses pseudo words that do not occur in spoken language to check the children’s ability to decode What are children supposed to say when they see ‘zued’ and ‘meve’ 2017 or ‘keam froim blies’ 2015 next to space aliens What are they expected to say when the see the real words ‘model’ 2017 ‘forest’ 2016 ‘river’ and ‘diving’ 2015 The separation of decoding from spoken language and the use of single cuing to decode print are two huge misconceptions at the heart of government reading policy They need to recognise these misconceptions and rectify the policy They especially should not enforce this policy through Ofsted recommendations in the Bold Beginnings document for children in the Reception Year  ** Other examples of the consecutive letters ‘ar er ir or ur’ are in ‘parrot berry mirror lorry hurry’ where the vowel is in the first syllable together with the first r and the second r is in the second syllable Although the fact that there is a double ‘rr’ should alert children that the preceding vowel is a ‘short’ vowel and it is not part of a digraph but when are they taught this  The two letters ‘oo’ in cooperate both have separate and distinct pronunciations The word ‘cooperate’ is made up of two morphemes ‘co’ and ‘operate’ Graphemes as digraphs never cross a morphemic boundary So ‘oo’ can never be pronounced as ‘oo’ in ‘moon’ or ‘oo’ in ‘look’ Similarly ‘going’ is made up of two morphemes ‘go’ and ‘ing’ so that ‘oi’ can never be pronounced as the single phoneme oi Similarly ‘mishap’ is made up of two morphemes ‘mis’ and ‘hap’ The words ‘aware reward towards’ are single morphemes where the consecutive letters are part of different syllables Then there the words carol zero biro coral guru  Bold Beginnings paragraph 47 apply phonic knowledge and skills as the route to decode words respond speedily with the correct sound to graphemes letters or groups of letters taught in the school’s phonics programme read accurately by blending sounds in unfamiliar words that used only the grapheme–phoneme correspondences GPCs that had been taught read a small number of exception words including common words and words of special interest to children highlighting to children any unusual correspondences between spelling and sound and where these occurred in the word read words without overt sounding and blending once children were cofident in their decoding but not before read aloud accurately books that were consistent with their developing phonic knowledge and that did not require them to use other strategies to work out words xa0 Time to stop!

Rachel Notley blasts BC governments move against Trans Mountain pipeline Keith Gerein Published on: January 30 2018 | Last Updated: January 30 2018 4:37 PM MST Alberta Premier Rachel Notley Codie McLachlan  Postmedia Share Adjust Comment Print Premier Rachel Notley blasted British Columbia’s provincial government Tuesday over its latest attempt to stall progress on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion calling the move an overreach of constitutional authority that will erode investor confidencexa0 “It is so far beyond the scope of what they have the legal authority to do they are creating a mockery out of our legal system” an angry Notley told reporters in Edmonton “The BC government has every right to consult on whatever it pleases with its citizens It does not have the right to rewrite our Constitution and assume powers for itself that it does not have If it did our confederation would be meaningless” Notley was reacting to BC’s proposal to restrict increases in bitumen shipments from Alberta until more spill response studies are conducted The announcement was aimed at Kinder Morgan’s pending $74billion pipeline expansion from Alberta to the West Coast which was approved in 2016 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau BC Premier John Horgan who took power last spring with backing from the province’s Green party has vowed to use every tool at his disposal to block the projectxa0 His NDP government wants to establish an independent scientific advisory panel to make recommendations whether heavy oils can be safely transported and cleaned up BC Environment Minister George Heyman said there needs to be more confidence in how well oil transporters are prepared to mitigate the effects of a spill Notley said the issue has already been decided and the alreadydelayed project needs to move forward She said she expects federal authorities to intervene because BC’s actions are illegal “It breaches a number of laws not the least of which includes the Constitution but is not only the Constitution” she said “The action announced today … can only be seen for what it is: political gameplaying and political theatre Unfortunately it is a game that could have serious consequences for the jobs and livelihoods of millions of Canadians who count on their governments to act within the scope of their authority” She said BC’s actions could send a chill through investors that the province and the country are willing to violate their own rules “Job creators need to be able to trust lawmakers and Tuesday’s announcement suggests that in BC they cannot” Alberta’s official Opposition echoed Notley’s stance that the BC move was illegal and unconstitutional “It’s extremely embarrassing for our premier that she’s been unable to persuade her fellow New Democrats to stop this attack on our province’s economy” United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney said Tuesdayxa0 The expansion would nearly triple the capacity of the current pipeline system to 890000 barrels a day With files from Clare Clancy and The Canadian Press

Reality Winner Arrest Tied To Same Reporters Behind CIA Whistleblower Prosecution Winner’s home was “swarmed” with FBI agents “most of whom were armed and took Ms Winner’s phone and car keys shortly after their arrival Where was Ms Winner supposed to go without her car or the ability to order alternative transportation from her phone Even if there were locations to which Ms Winner could wander on foot would any reasonable person believe in these circumstances that she could just walk out the door Of course not” If Winner’s defense succeeds in suppressing statements made to FBI agents it could be a key turning point in her case Axa0 transcript xa0indicates Winner made multiple statements that were incriminating or seemed to take responsibility for releasing the report to the Intercept without authorization The law turns on whether the court agrees Winner was in “custodial interrogation” when agents were in her home asking her to “voluntarily” provide information on a crime they believed she committed Several factors come into play that include: where she was questioned the length of questioning statements during questioning whether law enforcement had weapons whether she was ever touched whether language was used to compel compliance whether she was “unambiguously advised” she was free to leave whether law enforcement ever restrained her and whether she was released after questioning Keeping a detained suspect “in the dark” about their arrest is likely to “yield the pressures” which the pivotal casexa0Mirandaxa0warned against and make a situation “custodial” “Where a suspect is confused or unclear of her custodial status ‘she may feel compelled to submit to police questioning for fear that her refusal to cooperate will reduce her chances for release or other favorable treatment’” Winner’s defense contends citing case law Winner submitted a declaration  PDF  to the court on August 29 It contained her version of what happened the day she was interrogated and later arrested She recalls coming home from the grocery store Two “armed male FBI agents” were outside She claims she was advised the FBI had a search warrant for her house car and person Eight additional armed male FBI agents entered her front door to “rummage” through her house The two FBI agents she first encountered asked to speak with Winner “in a small unfurnished back room” which winner said was no more than seven by nine feet “I told the agents that the room was ‘creepy’ and ‘weird’ She did not like going back there But that’s where the agents insisted on doing the “interview” Winner says the door to this room was practically shut The two agents stood in front of the door blocking the exit After the agents asked her questions related to the alleged disclosure of classified information she asked if the FBI agents planned to arrest her The agents claimed they did not know maintaining an air of uncertainty The interrogation lasted about twentyfive minutes until she was “instructed to stand out” in her front yard Then she was “told” to go stand in the fenced yard with her dog Not long after two female agents arrived to arrest her In spite of the presence of FBI agents executing search warrants and controlling her movement around her own home the government asserts any reasonable person would have felt like they could “terminate the encounter” at any time like if she had asked the FBI to leave immediately they would have listened to her Winner’s defense maintains she was informed the FBI had a search warrant for her person but no agent attempted to immediately execute that search It lingered over the entire “interview” The government on the other hand insists the “search” of Winner was complete after she provided her cellphone to FBI agents which the defense finds dumbfounding “This makes no sense given the sequence of events” the defense declares “Ms Winner surrendered her cellular phone before the agents informed her they had a search warrant for her person When the agents subsequently told Ms Winner they had a warrant to search her they did not state that the warrant had already been executed by obtaining Ms Winner’s phone” “Even if the agents on the scene actually believed that they had executed that warrant in full by obtaining the phone which is highly doubtful a reasonable person in Ms Winner’s position certainly would not think that” the defense adds “Rather any reasonable person would believe as Ms Winner did that the search warrant for her person would be executed when the agents conducted a physical pat down or frisk” Winner’s trial remains scheduled for March 21 but a status report from January 8 indicated “numerous pretrial matters” made it nearly impossible for the government and defense to maintain the

Rhiannon Curry 31 January 2018 • 10:05pm Thexa0Cabinet Office was unable to confirm whether it had contingency plans in place for the failure of public sector contractor Capita after the company issued a shock profit warning scrapped its dividend and announced plans to raise £700m in order to avoid collapse The company which provides a variety of services to the public sector including running call centres for Jobseekers Allowance administering teachers’ pensions and providing an electronic monitoring service for the Ministry of Justice is estimated to have net debt of £11bn and a pension deficit of around £380m Its troubles have drawn comparisons with fellow outsourcer Carillion which plunged into liquidation last month under a pile of debt and carrying a huge pension deficit which could be up to £990m But the Cabinet Office could not provide details of any contingency plans that the Government had put in place to protect public services in the wake of another high profile collapse According to public sector data provider Tussell Capita is the biggest supplier of local government services in the country The FTSE 250 company was founded in 1984 and employs around 70000 staff Capita administers teachers pensions Credit: Dave Thompson Its new chief executive Jonathan Lewis who joined the company two months ago said in a trading update on Wednesdayxa0that the company was too thinly spread across different markets and had failed to invest enough in its own business while focusing too much on acquisitions to drive growth The company said that its 2017 trading had been in line with expectations but that underlying 2018 pretax profits would be lower at around £270m to £300m Capita had first warned of problems in Sept 2016 when thenchief executive Andy Parker blamed “continued delays in decision making and lower conversion of the pipeline” for a hit to profits Capita collapse | Current contracts and partnerships However Capita continued to win contracts from the public sector even after this point signing deals worth £451m between September 2016 and January 2018 Five of the 10 biggest public sector contracts awarded since Capita’s troubles became apparent were from the Cabinet Office including a £31m award to administer the Royal Mail’s pension scheme and a £23m management consultancy contract Nick Greatorex Capita’s chief financial officer said profits had been dented by the loss of contracts mostly in its private sector and IT services businesses and increases in costs including depreciation and from the adoption of axa0new data protection regime Analysts at Jefferies suggested consensus estimates of Capita’s 2018 earnings per share were likely to be 40pc lower than previously predicted on the back of today’s news “In the medium term cost savings should help we think £85m90m could be achievable but the revenue environment remains lacklustre” they said in a note Under Mr Lewiss plans he is looking to sell Capita’s car park management business ParkingEye and contractor registry Constructionline the proceeds of which will be used to pay off debts and reinvest in the company’s core operations Capita The Jefferies analysts suggested Mr Lewis could go further by shedding its German business and parts of its IT enterprise division Meanwhile hedge funds which had held a short position on Capita pocketed about £40m on Wednesday as the company’s share price collapsed 475pc to 20year lows of 1825p Around 4pc of the company’s shares were out on loan to short sellers more than the 35pc average across the FTSE 350 AQR the hedge fund run by American billionaire Cliff Asness made around £29m through its 29pc stake Capeview Capital made around £6m and Janus Henderson made around £51m Mr Parker also made £317000 on shares he sold in May last year which at Wednesdays closing price would have been worth less than £102000 What does Capita do Capita offers business services for both public and private sector clients including running call centres for O2 collecting licence fees for the BBC and providing software for emergency service control rooms Some of its largest contracts in recent years have been a £1bn agreement with the NHS to provide administrative services in primary care and a £400m deal with the Ministry of Defence to run its recruitment Who runs it Jonathan Lewis Jonathan Lewis joined the company in December from Amec Foster Wheeler Hes a turnaround specialist who is on his fourth project Nick Greatorex the chief financial officer was steering the ship while Mr Lewis was appointed and has been at the company for 12 years Could it be another Carillion crisis Capita boss Jonathan Lewis will be hoping that hes avoided another Carillion crisis by trying to raise money now Both firms have struggled from a lack of cash which means debt has built up and running costs have become more difficult to meet Capita has already tried to raise money by spinning offxa0Capitaxa0Asset Services to Link last year for £888m and Mr Lewis hopes another £700m will bring its debt down to more manageable levels Out of sorts | The other outsourcers who are now in the spotlight Carillion left it too late meaning by the time it came to raise money the market was not interested After the embarrassment of Carillion the Government is also unlikely to let Capita collapse Ifxa0Capitaxa0were to fail the ensuing political fallout would make Carillion look like a tea party Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets said What next Raising £700m via the stock market could take some time Mr Lewis is expected to update the market on progress later this year but would not be drawn on exact timing Capita is also seeking a buyer for two of its divisions ParkingEye which it purchased for £57m in 2013 and ConstructionLine which it paid £35m for in 2015 Related Topics 
RSS Nation घाटे में आई मोदी सरकार अब सरकारी संपत्तियों को बेचकर जुटा सकती है 1 खरब रुपये का फंड घाटे में आई मोदी सरकार अब सरकारी संपत्तियों को बेचकर जुटा सकती है 1 खरब रुपये का फंड Editor January 28 2018 नई दिल्ली।केंद्र की मोदी सरकार राजकोषीय घाटे को कम करने के लिए 157 अरब डॉलर यानी 1 खरब रुपये की रकम सरकारी संपत्तियों को बेचकर जुटा सकती है। राजकोषीय घाटे को नियंत्रण में रखने और आम चुनाव से पहले सामाजिक योजनाओं में बड़े पैमाने पर खर्च कर मतदाताओं को लुभाने के लिए सरकार की ओर से ऐसा कदम उठाया जा सकता है। इन्वेस्टमेंट बैंकर्स और अर्थशास्त्रियों का अनुमान है कि इस साल बड़े पैमाने पर विनिवेश करने के बाद अरुण जेटली की ओर से 1 अप्रैल से शुरू हो रहे नए फाइनांशियल इयर में भी बड़े पैमाने पर विनिवेश का लक्ष्य रखा जा सकता है। सरकारी रिफाइनिंग कंपनी हिंदुस्तान पेट्रोलियम ऐंड कॉर्पोरेशन लिमिटेड के 51 पर्सेंट शेयरों को ओएनजीसी द्वारा खरीदने समेत तमाम विनिवेश समझौतों से सरकार ने इस साल 925 अरब रुपये जुटाने का लक्ष्य रखा है। हाल ही में ओएनजीसी ने 369 रुपये में एचपीसीएल के शेयरों को खरीदने पर सहमति जताई है। उम्मीद की जा रही है कि ओएनजीसी और एचपीसीएल के बीच डील इस महीने के अंत तक पूरी हो जाएगी। इस डील के चलते सरकार को बजट तक विनिवेश के जरिए 725 अरब रुपये जुटाने में मदद मिलेगी। बीते 8 सालों में यह पहला मौका होगा जब भारत विनिवेश के अपने लक्ष्य से आगे निकल जाएगा। जीएसटी लागू होने के बाद से टैक्स कलेक्शन में कमी होने के चलते सरकार ने इस फाइनांशियल इयर में सरकारी कंपनियों में विनिवेश की गति को बढ़ा दिया है। सरकार ने इस साल के लिए राजकोषीय घाटे को कुल जीडीपी के 32 फीसदी तक सीमित रखने का लक्ष्य लिया है। इसके अलावा अगले साल के लिए यह टारगेट 3 फीसदी का ही रखा गया है। Click to add a comment Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked * Comment 
Sanderson and Maracle: Where is the federal governments Indigenous housing strategy Frances Sanderson Marc Maracle Published on: January 29 2018 | Last Updated: January 29 2018 12:46 PM EST Prime Minister Trudeau announces the governments National Housing Strategy in Toronto in late November Adam Scotti  Adam Scotti  PMOCPM Share Adjust Comment Print After more than 20 years of the federal government staying out of the housing game the release of Canada’s firstever National Housing Strategyxa0 in November was largely celebrated by Canadians as a monumental step in the right direction Our prime minister described it as a “robust comprehensive lifechanging plan” representing a “onceinageneration vision” The government’s key talking points focused on how the strategy would serve our nation’s most vulnerable and emphasized that “even one person living on the streets in Canada is too many” These powerful statements paint a hopeful picture for the future of housing in Canada But it will be an incomplete picture until Canada delivers on an Indigenous Housing Strategy How can we celebrate the new National Housing Strategy as a full plan to meet the needs of our country’s most vulnerable when it is not paired with a strategy to support the population who experience homelessness at the most acute rates in Canada How can we say “one person living on the streets is too many” when urban Aboriginalxa0peoples are close to 10 times more likely to experience homelessness than other Canadian urbanites How can we refer to a plan as “robust and lifechanging” while people living onreserve continue to face deplorable conditions How can we even refer to the Strategy as a national initiative when it leaves out an entire population of Canadians The federal Liberals have said they need more time for deeper consultations with Aboriginal peoples before they can develop and release their forthcoming Indigenous Housing Strategy They are right in acknowledging that the Aboriginal community requires a separate strategy to address our unique needs and that the strategy must be driven by Aboriginal perspectives But one is left to wonder: Why wasn’t this consultation prioritized sooner The National Housing Strategy has been years in the making Leaders housing advocates and social housing providers from Aboriginal communities have been ready and waiting for the government to engage with us For those experiencing homelessness or substandard living conditions – on top of a history of being grossly underserved by government – another year of waiting is simply too longxa0 Most current attention and limited federal funding have focused on addressing onreserve housing issues and there is no doubt that more must be done to improve intolerable living conditions onreserve But there is a rising need to improve housing conditions for Aboriginal peoples living offreserve as well They account for more than 85 per cent of Ontario’s total Aboriginal population and that number is growing fast The $25 million annually of dedicated nationwide housing funding for Aboriginal peoples not onreserve that was offered up in the 2017 federal budget does not go far enough Stretched across the country over a 10year period the limited funds will not make an impact in any meaningful wayxa0 In addition the original funding agreements between nonprofit housing providers and the federal government are beginning to expire Aboriginal providers are disproportionately affected by this because their tenants’ rents are often deeply subsidized The loss of federal subsidies will threaten the sustainability of these programs and ultimately lead to a significant loss of vital Aboriginal housing programs most of which provide social supports in addition to shelter and operate much like supportive housing If the government fails to step up with continued funding we will sadly see a rise in the already devastating Aboriginal homeless population xa0As we continue to wait on the federal Indigenous Housing Strategy the Province of Ontario has set a promising tone as it develops its own Indigenous strategy Ontario is consulting regularly with Aboriginal housing providers to ensure their voices are being heard recognizing there is often a cultural disconnect xa0The federal government has committed to taking a similar approach but only time will tell how it all will unfold It is absolutely crucial that the consultation process be structured in a way that makes space for Aboriginal perspectivesxa0Every decision must be informed by those who live the everyday realities of the Aboriginal community There can be nothing for us without us And without a strategy how can Canada claim to live up to its promises of truth and reconciliation while failing to deliver on the most basic needs for its Aboriginal peoplesxa0 xa0So let’s celebrate the federal government’s reengagement with housing Let’s celebrate new funding opportunities and promising new programs But let’s wait until all Canadians – especially our most vulnerable communities – can celebrate together If the federal government means it when it sayxa0even one person living on the streets in Canada is too many it is critical that it get the forthcoming Indigenous Housing Strategy right Frances Sanderson and Marc Maracle are cochairs of the Ontario NonProfit Housing Association’s ONPHA’s Urban Aboriginal Housing Advisory Committee ONPHA believes that secure decent and affordable housing is a human right and fundamental social determinant of health xa0

Save Government functions best when it is transparent and allows citizens the most access to know how those whom they’ve elected to represent them are fulfilling that democratic duty Open records laws are a critical means of doing so Guaranteeing that certain documents and correspondence are public records with some understandable exceptions offers a level of accountability that otherwise wouldn’t exist Last week’s opinion by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office that emails sent from senators to the University of Nebraska constitute public records represents a major victory for open government Perhaps no state agency has as broad of public records exemptions as the Legislature which passed legislation in 1983 that gave senators the authority not to release constituent correspondence if they so chose But that law shouldn’t – and doesn’t – apply to custodians of such communication that are subject to sunshine laws as stated in the response to a Journal Star reporter’s request for these emails Furthermore a key component of the effectiveness of open records laws is the timely receipt of documents requested The sooner those emails are made public the better for all parties involved Without question NU finds itself between a rock and a hard place in this situation The emails in question relate to last August’s confrontation at UNL between an undergraduate student recruiting for a conservative organization who was shouted down and flipped off by a graduate lecturer In the aftermath three state senators argued that the university was hostile toward free speech and displayed an institutional bias against conservative students To date the senators have failed to definitively prove their claims that hundreds of Nebraskans supposedly reached out to their offices alleging similar treatment The emails however may shed needed light on the matter – and either confirm or cast further doubt on the accuracy of their accusations We hope their release will calm the unfortunate partisan firestorm that has engulfed and overshadowed the university’s flagship Lincoln campus If that indeed comes to pass let this scenario illustrate the power information and disclosure can have in quieting political discord The opinion also comes with a farreaching impact No longer can public agencies use the Legislature’s selfappointed exemption as a shield from transparency Additionally any communication between senators and governmental bodies has been deemed public enhancing transparency and accountability in the state Now the recipients not the senators are the custodians of these records and must comply with open records requests Transparency is a powerful weapon but it isn’t a partisan one it cuts both ways Thanks to the attorney general’s office Nebraskans aiming to hold state officials accountable now have another arrow in their quiver  Love

Scrutiny over wood and coal fires in UK homes By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst 30 January 2018 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Burning wood and coal in peoples homes will come under scrutiny as part of a government drive to improve air pollution Ministers are calling for evidence to help improve air quality in cities They want people to ensure that wood is dry before burning and that solid fuels are as clean as possible But the UK is being given a final warning by the European Commission today for breaching laws on NOx emissions The government is being told it will face court action in Europe unless its planned Clean Air Strategy does what its supposed to While environmentalists may wonder whether todays announcement on homes fires is a smokescreen the government insists its not It says the domestic burning of house coal smokeless solid fuels and wet wood is the single largest primary contributor of harmful sooty particles Householders and businesses are being asked for their views on proposals to cut emissions The government says drying wood can reduce particles by half and produce more heat from less fuel A spokesman said it is considering a range of options to tackle particle emissions including: Encouraging consumers to switch from house coal by only allowing the sale of low sulphur smokeless alternatives The introduction of sulphur limits for all smokeless solid fuels And new powers for local authorities to take action for persistent smoke offences where local air quality is harmed Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey said: We all have a role to play in improving the air we breathe Many of us enjoy a cosy fire but burning dirtier fuel has a real impact on the quality of air for our family and friends Pollution is about more than just transport If we make the switch to burning cleaner domestic fuel we can continue to enjoy burning wood and smokeless coal in stoves and fires in our homes She says theyre not considering banning domestic burning Prof Frank Kelly from Kings College London told BBC News: If the particulates data are correct then yes its a good thing as its important that all sources of pollution are tackled in order to improve air quality to reach WHO guideline values Some academics said the homes fires consultation was a diversion from other government failings on pollution Rosie Rogers from Greenpeace said: Its not a good look when a government that promised environmental leadership has to be chivvied by Brussels into doing something about illegal air pollution Michael Gove promised to make cleaning up our cities air a top priority but has little to show for it as yet The government said it would solve air pollution overall in its Clean Air Strategy expected after Easter The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan wants to ban wood burning in the capital  but there will no enforcement powers to enter homes to see whether people are burning wood or not Also today it was revealed that the Brixton Road in London has already reached the NOx limit for the whole of 2018 Jonathan Bartley coleader of the Green Party said: The fact were not even out of January and Londons filthy air has already hit the yearly pollution limit is damning The Governments failure to tackle this public health emergency is just one of the cracks in its new green veneer If the Government is serious about tackling this crisis it must bring forward the ban on petrol and diesel cars introduce a proper scrappage scheme invest in public transport and expand clean air zones across the country

Share on Linkedin Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely has questioned the Government in Parliament on the cost benefits of HS2 and urged it to invest in rail services on the Island and Southern England Speaking the Commons yesterday Tuesday Bob alsoxa0asked ministers to find money for a feasibility study to look at extending the Island Line into Newport and on to Ventnor and said he will write to the Department for Transport asking for more Island and Southern England investment Bob said HS2 was “extraordinarily expensive” at £52 billion with poor returns and by the Government’s own admission it has a cost benefit ratio of 1:23 which he described as “poor” Article continues below this advertisment Mr Seely told MPs: “HS2 does nothing for capacity for southern rail or for southwest rail The southwest rail network is crying out for investment We need rail flyovers at Woking and at Basingstoke to get more services on that line We need to update the signalling system between Waterloo and Woking and eventually elsewhere on the line to improve speeds and services “We need infrastructure on the Portsmouth line to increase capacity Getting from London to Portsmouth you travel at an average speed of around 45 miles an hour and the idea that we are spending billions building a rail network to go superfast up north when we are still travelling at branchline speeds on mainline routes in the south of England is very galling to very many constituents in constituencies across southern England” The councillorturnedMP has asked the Government to commit to prioritising the necessary work on the southwest rail route that could speed up journey times between London and south coast destinations such as Portsmouth Southampton Bournemouth and the Isle of Wight Bob said: “My letter will cover support for investment support for a feasibility study and dependent on the results of that study support for the branch line and capital work on Ryde Pier Head to ensure that the railway line there stays feasible continues and has a future” He then asked the minister Nus Ghani: “Will the Minister assure me that the Department will not be telling me that a feasibility study is not possible because of cost Will the Minister assure me that if a feasibility study recommends extension of our lines that will be supported given that the costs involved £10 million to £30 million are margins of error in Government accounting in the Department of Transport “Will the Minister assure me that there will be support for infrastructure projects both for the South Western Railway network and the Island line notwithstanding the considerable amounts of money that are been spent elsewhere” Comment on this story The views and opinions expressed by individuals in the comments section above do not represent those of Island Echo its employees or advertisers

Share Tweet The UK government’s mass surveillance program allowing for the indiscriminate collection of people’s personal data has been ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal Large parts of the government’s Investigatory Powers Act 2016 – dubbed the snoopers charter – must be amended as it runs contrary to EU law the Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday The judges ruled that the legislation based on the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 is unlawful as bulk data collection was being carried out for reasons other than to tackle serious crime They also contested the fact that it empowered police and authorities to engage in the practice of harvesting people’s personal information without obtaining prior consent from a court or and independent body The legal challenge was launched by Labour MP Tom Watson along with Brexit Secretary David Davis in 2014 Davis however withdrew when he took up his ministerial role Responding to the ruling Watson said: “This legislation was flawed from the start It was rushed through parliament just before recess without proper parliamentary scrutiny He added:The government must now bring forward changes to the Investigatory Powers Act to ensure that hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are innocent victims or witnesses to crime are protected by a system of independent approval for access to communications data “I’m proud to have played my part in safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights” Watson told the Guardian Did you like this article Thank you for your vote!

Socialism is love and subscriptions are $14 today Interview by Julia Damphouse Four months after Germany’s federal election the eurozone’s most powerful state remains without a government In September both members of its grand coalitionxa0—xa0 Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic Union CDU and Martin Schulz ’s Social Democratic Party SPDxa0— lost a significant numbers of seats This opened a path of increased political influence for the farright Alternative for Germany AfD Initially the SPD responded to these results by insisting it would not govern with the centerright again But as the months have worn on and other coalition formations have fallen by the wayside that determination has waned Now the grand coalition known as GroKo short for Große Koalition is back on the table with an SPD convention voting narrowly to open negotiations But this time around there appears to be significant resistance within the party to a deal with its youth wing JUSOS leading a campaign to reject it  Their cause has been boosted by the latest polls in Germany which show the SPD falling even farther and only four points ahead of the farright So what does all this mean for the German left And how can Die Linke itself coming to terms with a disappointing election result respond to the situation Jacobin’s Julia Damphouse talks to Die Linke MP Fabio de Masi about the latest developments Towards Coalition JD Englishlanguage coverage has been sparse since Germany’s election in September could you give an overview of what has happened particularly with respect to coalition talks FD The first noticeable election result was the Alternative for Germany finishing strongly on 13 percent There was no clearcut majority for Angela Merkel so she attempted to form a “Jamaica”xa0coalition between her conservative Christian Democratic Union the liberal Free Democratic Party FDP and the Greens The name comes from their combined colors: black yellow and green respectivelyxa0After nearly a month of negotiations the FDP decided to pull out of negotiations My impression was that they wanted to use their leverage at the negotiating table to get Merkel to step down Coming out strongly against Merkel allowed them to appeal to traditional rightwing voters that have moved towards the AfD While these negotiations were ongoing Martin Schulz the chairman of the Social Democrats SPD ruled out reentering government in a new grand coalition Instead he wanted to renew the position of social democracy as the official oppositionxa0But now that the possibility of a Jamaica coalition is off the table the only other viable arrangement is a grand coalitionxa0Last weekend the SPD held a national congress and there a slim majority of delegates 56 percent voted to go ahead with coalition negotiations with the CDU There are three basic reasons advanced by those in the SPD who support entering coalition negotiations First is that they are scared not entering negations will mean snap elections likely in April which will see the SPD get an even worse result than their historicallylow 20 percent in September Party functionaries are worried rightly but cynically that they will lose their jobs Second they know that not entering government will mean formerly highranking ministers will be just regular members of parliament again Third they think that Merkel’s back is against the wall that the CDU will be desperate to form a governing coalition and that the SPD will be able to dictate the terms of the agreement in their favor There have been some advance talks where possible terms of the coalition agreement were discussed It doesn’t seem as though the Social Democrats will gain much of substancexa0One area they are pursuing is stabilizing the pension level at 48 percent of the average income a worker earns during their worklife It was previously 53 percent under a conservative government and in fact the SPD were responsible for the policies which cut it in the first place But before any agreement can be made the question of whether the SPD will enter another grand coalition will be put to a vote of the whole party membershipxa0The youth wing of the SPD JUSOS has launched a campaign to encourage people opposed to a grand coalition to join the party and vote against the coalition talks JD JUSOS’s campaign has been compared to Momentum the movement around Jeremy Corbyn in the British Labour Party Does the comparison have merit FD I don’t think it’s a valid comparison First of all there is no Corbyn in the SPD  Corbyn’s leadership campaign represented a real prospect of drastically changing the political direction of one of the most neoliberal socialdemocratic parties in Europe Whereas here the aim is simply to fend off another grand coalition That being said despite the difference in scope this is one of the most intense internal debates within German social democracy in years It’s not something to ignore but the whole campaign against a grand coalition lacks a political program That is their weak point JD So the NoGroKo campaign is notxa0Momentumxa0But is there any possibility that the SPD might swing to the left in the future FD The only way the SPD could move left was if it had a political project being articulated by those in the SPD who oppose the politics of the previous grand coalitionsxa0It’s not enough to sayxa0“no GroKo” there must be a political agendaxa0The left wing of social democracy has not voiced strong criticism on concrete programmatic grounds They talk sometimes about tax justice for example but there is little critical engagement with the policies of the European Union and Germany’s role within it That is not to say there isn’t a desire for more radical positions Many of the rankandfile members of the party support Die Linke policies but there is no credible figure right now within the SPD who can represent a more leftwing programxa0There are wellintentioned people like the leader of the party’s youth Kevin Kühnert who warns against the party’s selfdestruction via a new grand coalition but he does not articulate a more positive vision of what the SPD should look like This conversation has yet to take place JD In September’s election the AfD came third in terms of seats If there was another grand coalition they would become the official opposition Some see this as the strongest reason for the SPD to stay out But if they do are we doomed to four years of debate on the AfD’s terms FD The rise of the AfD is the result of the apparent lack of alternatives in German politics Their name is no coincidence But they aren’t a real alternative on most grounds they are not only racist but against workers’ rights and in favor of tax cuts for the rich  They’re clever however and try to align themselves with older and more isolated segments of Germany’s deindustrialized workforcexa0The policies of Germany’s centerright and centerleft parties has laid the groundwork for the kind of social unrest that the AfD capitalizes on Therefore the argument that the SPD should stay out of government in order to prevent the AfD from being the opposition is not enough They will still be seen as the alternative until the SPD or Die Linke are able to challenge the political establishment When Schulz was first elected leader of the SPD he hinted at reversing some of the labor market reforms that his party introduced with the Agenda 2010 Even vaguely gesturing in this direction caused the party’s polling to go up by nearly 10 percent However the SPD stayed in government instead of using a potential majority with Die Linke and the Greens in the last parliament to correct some of their past mistakes cause snap elections and set the agenda Hence the Schulz hype was only temporary There is a substantial section of voters that the SPD could tap into who are disappointed but who also have unfortunately not become Die Linke voters Left Opposition Why has Die Linke failed to pick up more of the disaffected former SPD voters FD Some of the voters while in favor of our demands on things like pension reforms and ending German military presence abroad don’t believe that we have the capacity to actually enact these policies In the UK people rallied around Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party because there was the prospect of changing the direction of the country Die Linke lacks that capacityxa0And from Sahra Wagenknecht to Katja Kipping there exists a range of very different concepts of political strategy for the party We must accept that we lost some of our popular appeal as antiestablishment force to the AfD However another grand coalition could lead to the implosion of the SPD The question would then become are we able to attract those who become even further disillusioned JD Last time you spoke with Jacobin  you mentionedxa0Sahraxa0Wagenknecht’s interest in formingxa0a leftwing populist movement inspired by Mélenchon’s France Insoumise  Could something like this present a new opportunity for the Left in Germany FD Sahra Wagenknecht is right with two observationsxa0The first is that over the past decade there has been a shift of voters away from the parties of the Left Around the turn of the millennium the combined votes of Die Linke the SPD and the Greens consistently constituted a majority However this majority was never utilized and now even if we were to still consider the Greens to be a left force these three parties could no longer form a majority in government Second the fact that Die Linke has not been able to win over millions of disaffected former SPD voters and or their members

Steve Baker a Brexit minister told MPs that the leaked forecasts should be ignored Credit: REUTERSPeter Nicholls Here are five things that Steve Baker  one of the Government’s Brexit ministers told MPs today 1 Economic forecasts are “always wrong” 2 The Government has asked civil servants to work out what growth will be like after Brexit 3 In time for the Commons vote on the final Brexit deal the civil servants’ findings will be given to MPs to help them make “an informed decision” 4 The findings that have been leaked to the media may suggest that growth will be much slower outside the EU but this should be ignored because the findings are only “preliminary” 5 The leaked findings make it “clear” that the country “will be better off” Or to put it another way: Economic forecasts are always wrong so naturally the Government has commissioned some economic forecasts It has not yet published the economic forecasts because they’re both wrong and unfinished but promises to publish them at a later To continue reading this article Start a 30day free trial for unlimited access to Premium articles Unlimited access to Premium articlesxa0 Subscriberonly events and experiences

Tech Talk Geeks Come to the Governments Rescue The organization some refer to as the Peace Corps for geeks has launched a major effort to improve the way people apply for benefits February 2018 By Tod Newcombe xa0|xa0 Columnist America’s safety net is huge It keeps more than 50 million people above the poverty line with a combination of benefits that support everything from health care and education to housing and food assistance But thanks to complex eligibility rules enrolling for even one of these benefits can be complicated Just imagine trying to enroll for several benefits at the same time Not surprisingly when it comes to government technology integrated benefits enrollment is more a lofty goal than a reality Yet it’s a challenge that Code for America CfA which matches cities with software developers to solve a problem has decided to tackle CfA is working with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative the philanthropic organization started by Facebook’s cofounder and his wife as well as with the tech startup Nava the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the US Department of Health and Human Services and the state of Michigan CfA hopes to strip out the complexity  and cost  that gives online benefits enrollment such a bad name The goal then is to design a simple way to enroll people who are eligible for both Medicaid and food stamps RELATED Digital Tools and the Need for Better Governance Whats the Best Way to Enroll People in Medicaid Food Stamps Can Cut Seniors Health Costs But Most Arent Using Them Jennifer Pahlka founder and executive director of CfA says the team is “using approaches that have been successful and are starting to have significant outcomes” These approaches include a humancentric design as opposed to one that is bureaucratic and rulesbased and an iterative development methodology in which pieces of software code are designed quickly and collaboratively The result is less expensive software that is usable right away rather than having to wait for one massive system that is often delivered late over budget and with several system bugs The organization often relies on open source tools which reduces the cost of its solutions These approaches were tested in California in 2015 when CfA revamped the state’s online enrollment for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program The effort simplified a stodgy online application process that once took a person a teethgnashing 45 minutes to complete CfA cut the time to less than 10 minutes Just as it plans to do with Michigan the goal was to keep things simple says Pahlka And it did The new enrollment program sits on top of rather than replaces the underlying systems Once the integrated enrollment software has been tested and proven to work in Michigan the hope is that other states will deploy it making it a national model for online enrollment Kevin Desouza a professor of public affairs at Arizona State University says CfA has taken the right approach in bringing together different groups from different political environments to get the kind of buyin necessary to overcome possible governance and policy challenges that might arise “Initiatives like this where you have an external organization conducting the assessment and building the prototype remove risk for the agencies” he says But building an integrated enrollment solution isn’t easy Getting past hurdles that include data privacy security control and access by multiple agencies can be challenging says Desouza He adds that most state IT infrastructure is not open source which can add some friction to how the technology is used But Pahlka who calls CfA “the Peace Corps for geeks” is excited about the project’s impact “It’s going to make more benefits accessible to more people and it’s going to challenge government around the negative impact of working in silos” And on that quote I want to take this time to let you know that this will be my last column After this month Tech Talk will no longer appear in this magazine I’ve enjoyed breaking down important technology issues and what they mean for states and cities and I want to thank you for reading along I’m moving on to new endeavors within the company where I’ll continue writing about the intersection of technology and government

Text by NEWS WIRES Latest update : 20180131 Southern Yemeni separatists took control of the port city of Aden after two days of fighting residents said on Tuesday confining the internationally recognised government of President AbdRabbu Mansour Hadi to the presidential palace Fighting between southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates UAE  against forces loyal to Saudibased president Hadi  risk crippling their once united campaign against the Iran aligned Houthi movement in Yemen’s north  The UAE is a major component of a Saudiled military coalition of Arab states that has supported Hadi’s government since the Houthis seized much of the country including the capital Sanaa three years ago Hadi’s government operates out of Aden while he lives in Saudi Arabia  Residents said forces loyal to the Southern Transitional Council STC formed last year to push for the revival of the former independent state of South Yemen seized the last stronghold of Hadi’s Presidential Protection Forces in the Dar Saad area of northern Aden in battles that at times involved heavy artillery and tank fire Activists shared photos on social media of the flag of the former independent Southern Yemen state flying over the base’s gate Southern Yemen was united with Northern Yemen in 1990 >> Yemen on the brink: Civil war famine and a growing separatist movement Aden residents said STC fighters had earlier overrun Presidential Protection forces outposts in central Aden’s Crater and Tawahi districts They stopped outside the alMaasheeq palace where Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr’s cabinet is based they said Witnesses said hundreds of people danced and sang as they celebrated the STC victory with fireworks that lit the night skies over Aden The crowd chanted slogans demanding restoration of the southern state Mosques also mixed their calls for prayers with victory claims in Crater residents said ‘All measures’ The governmentrun Saba news agency put the death toll in two days of fighting at 16 and the number of wounded at 141 An official at the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC said at least 36 were killed and 185 were wounded The fighting began on Sunday after a deadline set last week by the STC for Hadi to dismiss bin Daghr’s government which the STC accused of corruption and mismanagement The government denies the allegation Sources at the STC said negotiations were underway to allow bin Daghr’s government to leave the city safely but a government source said bin Daghr had no intention of leaving Aden STC head Aydaroos alZubaydi in his first public comments since the fighting began said the separatists were still committed to the coalition’s goals of driving the Houthis out of Sanaa but he declined to say whether he intended to set up a separate administration in Aden “We have tasks alongside the Arab coalition and its Decisive Storm operation But the people of the South have the right to their own state when the international community is ready for that” Zubaydi said in an interview with the Arabic channel of France 24 TV The Saudiled coalition which intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to restore Hadi’s government after the Houthis forced him into exile called in a statement on Tuesday on both parties to cease hostilities “The coalition will take all the measures it deems necessary to restore stability and security in Aden” it said Although Hadi remains in exile in Saudi Arabia his administration and local allies nominally control about fourfifths of Yemen’s territory although most population centres are in the hands of the Houthis The factional fighting in the south compounds the misery of Yemenis whose country has been torn apart by three years of conflict between Hadi’s forces and the Houthis which has also opened the way for Islamist militants to widen their influence In the southern Shabwa province at least 12 soldiers from another local force trained and backed by the UAE were killed in a bomb and gun attack on their outpost residents and officials said While no one claimed responsibility for the attack it mirrored previous operations by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula AQAP REUTERS

Center for Investigative Reporting filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for failing to respond to our request for public information Earlier this month we amended the complaint after we received an incomplete response from the agency which repeatedly has failed to fulfill its obligations under the law<p> <p>Here’s how it started: Last summer we <a href=https:wwwrevealnewsorgarticleajudgesaidthesekidsgetagreencardicesaystheygetdeported>ran a story<a> about a surprising immigration case While one part of the federal government wanted to give migrant kids a green card another one wanted to deport them<p> <p>What explains the internal conflict An often undertheradar policy called expedited removal which allows immigrants caught at US borders to be immediately deported without the chance to make their case in front of a judge I found some cases in which US citizens had been wrongfully deported<p> <p>At the same time expedited removal was getting renewed attention because President Donald Trump had issued an executive order soon after he assumed office that called for <a href=https:wwwrevealnewsorgarticlehowtrumpisexpandingthegovernmentssecretdeportationweapon>expanding the use of the policy<a> beyond borders to the entire United States<p> <p>It seemed like a good time and place to do some digging on the topic As part of the reporting I was doing on the case of the migrant kids I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with US Customs and Border Protection which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security I asked for documents that would help me understand the policies and procedures that Border Patrol agents use when deporting someone through expedited removal <p> <p>My underlying reason for this request was simple Expedited removal gives agents extraordinary powers over migrants’ lives I wanted to understand how agents decide to put someone into expedited removal what kind of discretion they have and how they are instructed by the government to go about using this quickfire deportation policy<p> <p>I then moved on to producing an <a href=https:wwwrevealnewsorgarticlehowtrumpisexpandingthegovernmentssecretdeportationweapon>article<a> and a <a href=https:wwwrevealnewsorgepisodesinsidetrumpsimmigrationcrackdown>radio segment<a> with my colleague Andrew Becker about the potential expansion of expedited removal We hoped that we would begin to receive materials from the government before we completed that reporting in late October <p> <p>We never did So we filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Dec 19<p> <p>The day after the lawsuit was filed I finally received a response from Customs and Border Protection The agency said it had located 166 pages of relevant materials but was withholding 121 of them entirely Of the nine pages the agency released every one of them was redacted in some way The agency also said several pages already were public and gave us two web links Both of those links were broken<p> <p>So earlier this month we filed an amended legal complaint The latest version argues that Customs and Border Protection not only failed to respond in a timely manner to my FOIA request but also that its search was insufficient<p> <p>We know for instance that Customs and Border Protection didn’t turn over all relevant documents because we have learned that additional materials were disclosed to other news or legal groups <p> <p>So our battle for public information continues We’ll keep you updated on our progress as we fight to get ahold of documents that will help us answer a straightforward question: What does the government tell a Border Patrol agent about who to send

The Cabinet Files reveal national security breaches NBN negotiations welfare reform plans By political reporter Ashlynne McGhee and Michael McKinnon Updated February 10 2018 10:31:28 Hundreds of topsecret and highly classified cabinet documents have been obtained by the ABC following an extraordinary breach of national security This was not a leak — heres what it took to unlock national secrets The Cabinet Files is one of the biggest breaches of cabinet security in Australian history and the story of their release is as gripping as it is alarming and revealing It begins at a secondhand shop in Canberra where exgovernment furniture is sold off cheaply The deals can be even cheaper when the items in question are two heavy filing cabinets to which noone can find the keys They were purchased for small change and sat unopened for some months until the locks were attacked with a drill Inside was the trove of documents now known as The Cabinet Files The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade Nearly all the files are classified some as top secret or AUSTEO which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only But the exgovernment furniture sale was not limited to Australians — anyone could make a purchase And had they been inclined there was nothing stopping them handing the contents to a foreign agent or government AFP lost hundreds of national security files The Australian Federal Police AFP lost nearly 400 national security files in five years according to a secret government stocktake contained in The Cabinet Files The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet regularly audits all government departments and agencies that have access to the classified documents to ensure they are securely stored The missing documents are not the same files the ABC has obtained The classified documents lost by the AFP are from the powerful National Security Committee NSC of the cabinet which controls the countrys security intelligence and defence agenda The secretive committee also deploys Australias military and approves kill capture or destroy missions Most of its documents are marked top secret and AUSTEO which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only Infographic: A conversation between the Australian Federal Police and and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about National Security Committee documents ABC News: Georgina Piper An email exchange between the cabinet secretariat and the AFP reveals the documents were lost between 2008 and 2013 while Labor was in government The exchange does not reveal any investigation by either the secretariat or the AFP into how the documents were lost who lost them or where they might be now It also does not reveal the nature nor the content of the missing NSC documents Troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq counterterrorism operations foreign relations and Australias border protection were among the topsecret and sensitive issues decided in the fiveyear period The cabinet secretariats general practice was to give up searching and write off lost documents if they could not be found after consecutive audits according to another document in The Cabinet Files The ABC has contacted the AFP for comment Photo: Stocktake reports do not clarify exactly which documents went missing ABC News: Nick Haggarty Classified files left behind in Wongs office Photo: Penny Wong was the leader of the government in the Senate and a member of the NSC at the time ABC News: Jed Cooper Nearly 200 topsecret code word protected and sensitive documents were left in a safe in the office of senior minister Penny Wong when Labor lost the 2013 election The 195 documents included Middle East defence plans national security briefs Afghan war updates intelligence on Australias neighbours and details of counterterrorism operations These are not the same documents the ABC has obtained as part of The Cabinet Files nor are they the same documents lost by the Australian Federal Police  The sensitive documents found in Senator Wongs office should have been destroyed according to a document in The Cabinet Files All the documents were security classified with several marked top secret and code word protected which is the highest level of classification in Australia The release of topsecret documents would cause exceptionally grave damage to the national interest according to the governments classification guide Senator Wong was the leader of the government in the Senate and a member of the powerful National Security Committee NSC which means she had access to the countrys most secret and sensitive information The breach is revealed in a series of emails between the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from late 2013 The emails reveal security staff found the documents left in a Bclass safe in the office after the election and oversaw their destruction Westminster convention stipulates cabinet ministers bear the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their staff which means Senator Wong is ultimately responsible for the breach even if she did not personally leave the documents in the office The documents found in Senator Wongs office include: Defence plans to protect the United Arab Emirates from Iranian hostilities National security intelligence priorities Issues with Australian Defence Force operations in Afghanistan Deficiencies in Defence security vetting Explore the full list of documents left in Penny Wongs office  The office of the new prime minister Tony Abbott was notified of the security breach in October 2013 The Department of Finance investigated the security breach but took no further action because they had no proof of who left them there Senator Wong told the ABC she had not been made aware of the matter until the release of The Cabinet Files This is the first time I have ever been made aware of this matter which relates to a change of government over four years ago she said in a statement As a former cabinet minister who participated in national security meetings a senior member of shadow cabinet and a current member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I always take my responsibilities seriously Right to remain silent nearly removed under Howard Photo: Thenprime minister John Howard and his National Security Committee gave serious consideration to the proposal AAP: David Moir John Howards National Security Committee NSC gave serious consideration to removing an individuals unfettered right to remain silent when questioned by police The powerful committees debate on counterterrorism laws came just after the arrest of Mohammed Haneef and is documented in files marked secret and AUSTEO which stands for Australian eyes only Dr Haneef was accused of providing assistance in the 2007 Glasgow terror attack but amid huge public controversy the allegations were later disproven and Dr Haneef was awarded compensation by the Australian government The cabinet documents reveal thenattorneygeneral Philip Ruddock pushed for a range of new offences while Dr Haneef was still under investigation Critically one of the proposals was to modify the right to remain silent during a terrorism investigation I would also like NSC to consider whether amendments should be made to a suspects right to remain silent to allow a court to draw adverse inferences in a terrorism trial where an accused relies on evidence which he or she failed to mention when questioned by police Mr Ruddock wrote in his NSC submission The proposal was supported by the Australian Federal Police and ASIO but rejected by the majority of the senior ministers in the NSC Liberal MP Kevin Andrews is the only current politician who was a member of the NSC at that time Current ASIO directorgeneral Duncan Lewis was then an adviser in the prime ministers National Security Division and along with a colleague he argued strongly against Mr Ruddocks proposal Implementing a new provision to allow adverse inferences to be drawn from a failure to mention something when questioned is likely to involve more risks than benefits and will engage lawyers much earlier on in any investigation Mr Lewis wrote He also warned the raft of proposed changes would be controversial Any strengthening of the counterterrorism powers will attract significant media and public debate Mr Lewis said A spokeswoman for Mr Howard told the ABC he did not comment on discussions in the NSC but pointed out that no such change to the law was made The ABC has also contacted Mr Ruddock and Mr Andrews for comment Andrew Bolt consulted on changes to 18C Photo: Andrew Bolt was found to have breached section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act AAP: Mick Tsikas The divisive political commentator who breached section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act was consulted when the federal government moved to change it according to the draft legislation contained in The Cabinet Files The cabinet documents reveal Andrew Bolt was asked how to stop the acts unreasonably restrictive reach that led to the successful claim against him in 2011 Bolt denies he was consulted on changes to the act I was not consulted but was once told what had been decided he told the ABC I had absolutely no role at all in drafting legislation Concerns I expressed about the ambit of the proposed changes had no effect The Federal Court ruled Bolt breached the act when he published an opinion piece about

The empty Capitol Rotunda during the 2013 shutdown Chip SomodevillaGetty Images Here’s what closes down and what doesn’t Congress has missed a government shutdown deadline The House and Senate had until midnight on Friday January 19 to pass a spending bill before the federal government ran out of money and closed its doors Despite controlling every lever of government Republicans are somehow faced with the possibility that they can’t get the votes together to keep the government open It’s been more than four years since the last government shutdown but after copious experience with shutdowns especially during the protracted budget standoffs of the Clinton and Obama presidencies we have a good sense of what will happen to the federal government What a government “shutdown” looks like Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti who laid out what modern government shutdowns look like with Jimmy Carter in 1979 Walter BennettThe LIFE Picture CollectionGetty Images When Congress can’t pass some kind of appropriations bill before a spending deadline the government shuts down and many “nonessential” government activities suddenly cease It’s not unusual for Congress to go to the brink of shutdown it happened as recently as this past fall when President Trumpxa0 threatened a shutdown xa0in a bid to get funding for a border wall The government hasxa0 officially shut down 18 times xa0since the modern process that Congress uses to pass budget and spending bills took effect in 1976 The first six of those didn’t actually affect the functioning of government at all It wasn’t until a set of opinions issued byxa0 Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti xa0in 1980 and ’81 that the government started to treat “spending gaps” — periods when Congress has failed to allocate funds for the ongoing functions of government — as necessitating the full or partial shutdown of government agencies But from the Reagan years onward any period in which Congress failed to pass funding measures has meant that major chunks of the government stop operatingxa0 Whichxa0parts differ from shutdown to shutdown  but it generally excludes essential services without which the economy would grind to a halt and people would die During shutdowns federal employees are divided into “essential” and “nonessential” groups the official wording was changed to “excepted” and “nonexcepted” in 1995 to avoid hurting people’s feelings Nonessential personnel receive furloughs: They’re off work until the shutdown is resolved and stop receiving paychecks In the October 2013 shutdownxa0 about 850000 federal workers xa0received furloughs or about 40 percent of all federal nonmilitary employees After shutdowns furloughed workers almost always receive retroactive payments covering their salaries during the shutdown Essential workersxa0alsoxa0see their pay withheld — but they have to work anyway Who is exempted and not exempted Despite President Trump’s tendency to point to the military as thexa0 biggest victim xa0of a potential shutdown it’s not — the military is of course generally considered “essential” to the functioning of the US government And just as law enforcement agents have become the domestic mirror image of soldiers in conservative identity politics they’re also considered essential employees across all government agencies Air traffic control federal prisons and Social Security and other benefit payments also generally keep functioning as normal during shutdowns But many other government functions are curtailed In thexa0 2013 shutdown  the effects of the furloughs and other shutdowns in government activity included: Tax refunds totaling almost $4 billion were delayed Thexa0 Women Infants and Children nutrition program xa0went unfunded Federal research activities at the National Institutes of Health which lost about threequarters of its employees the National Science Foundation which lost 98 percent of its workforce and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which lost twothirds shut down nearly entirely the CDC scaled back its monitoring of disease outbreaks Environmental Protection Agency inspections halted at 1200 locations The Food and Drug Administration delayed approval of drugs and medical devices The national parks shut down resulting in $500 million in lost consumer spending from tourism Reviews of veterans’ disability applications slowed to a halt with nearly 20000 applications per week not being evaluated In total the Office of Management and Budget estimated that the shutdown cut GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 by 02 to 06 points and resulted in 120000 fewer jobs So while shutdowns don’t result in seniors going without their retirement checks or the military closing up shop or airplanes crashing into each other in the sky they do cause massive disruption in the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families and grind a lot of government agencies to a halt Immigration agencies are slowed down The exception for law enforcement means that the overwhelming majority of Border Patrol customs officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will remain on duty through a shutdown — and that the Trump administration’s steppedup enforcement of immigration laws including greater arrests of immigrants without criminal records is as essential as anything else But it isn’t in itself essential to facilitate legal immigration to the US US Citizenship and Immigration Services will largely be unaffected by the shutdown simply because it doesn’t get its money from Congress it’s funded by the fees it charges applicants But companies seeking work visas for their employees might run into trouble because the Department of Labor office that needs to approve their petition would be closed Overseas consular offices while they could stay open over a brief shutdown by running off fee money could end up being closed if the shutdown is prolonged — making it impossible for people in those countries to get approved to come to the US until the government reopened And while the US Refugee Admissions Program isn’t technically subject to shutdown the Obama administrationxa0 stopped bringing refugees to the US xa0during the 2013 shutdown anyway because of the anticipated difficulty getting Social Security cards and other vital resources to refugees once they arrived in the United States Feeding refugees is considered an essential function of the State Department but resettling them permanently isn’t on the same level That’s an appropriate balance if you think the parts of the US government that exist to punish lawbreakers are more essential to daytoday operations than the parts that allow people to follow the laws But that is itself a skewed view of what’s most important about the government — and about who can afford to wait for days or weeks while a shutdown is resolved in Washington A government that provides routine inspections and generates information isn’t “essential” Not all “law enforcement” or security efforts are created equal under shutdown plans of course and regulatory agencies are generally given short shrift Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms field offices are exempt from shutdowns many Food and Drug Administration officials working on investigations however are not The TSA is fully exempt but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had to furlough a large fraction of its staff Civil litigation efforts at the Department of Justice including antitrust investigations would cease the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Mine Health and Safety Administration would be temporarily all but gutted In a way all of these are either security or law enforcement functions of government But the “essential” government doesn’t think that every official whose job is to check compliance with the laws is an essential one — even if those laws could in theory be protecting people from health and safety hazards At OSHA the FDA and the Mine Health and Safety Administration for example what gets shut down are “routine” inspections and investigations Emergency efforts — mines near collapsexa0 largescale food or drug recalls xa0— can proceed or be initiated but the daytoday compliance efforts that are supposed to prevent those emergencies from happening can’t For progressives who see consumer protection as an important function of the federal government this is arbitrary even insulting though partisans can take some glee in knowing that thexa0 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau xa0itself is unaffected by shutdown For libertarians and businessminded conservatives who see overregulation and red tape as a serious chilling effect on entrepreneurship in America it’s an admittedly extreme version of the regulatory state they’d like to see to begin with And then there are the parts of the government dedicated primarily to the production of knowledge — a function that’s been underappreciated in the past but that has come to the fore as worries have spread that the Trump administration is neglecting it At the Environmental Protection Agency where administrator Scott Pruitt is openly contemptuous of employees and where some employees have all but started smuggling out data before it gets destroyed the overwhelming majority of staff would be furloughed The Bureau of Labor Statistics would stop releasing reports as would the Bureau of Justice Statistics Work at the US Census Bureau which is already behind in preparations for the 2020 census wouldxa0 grind to a halt  These are things that people who care about “good

The government was just mauled by its own watchdog over how it deals with immigration cases January 30th 2018 UK The government’s Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration has issued a damning report on the state of the UK’s immigration and asylum legal system And he didn’t mince his words saying he found “no evidence that would support… optimism” that things would improve Overarching concerns On Tuesday 30 January the Chief Inspector David Bolt published his report pdf on the “Home Office’s approach to learning from immigration litigation” That is court action taken against it by immigrants refugees and asylum seekers And Bolt’s criticism of what the Home Office had or hadn’t learnt was overarching He noted that “between 2004 and 2013 the number of Judicial Reviews lodged against the Home Office increased sevenfold” And while Bolt acknowledged pdf p8 that the actions of claimants and the courts are “not within the Home Office’s control” he raised the following concerns: The government was constantly missing pdf p12 its own target for responding to legal claims even though Bolt considered the targets to be “low” No Service Level Agreement between the Home Office and the Government’s Legal Department had been agreed pdf p13 xa0and unnecessary duplication of records was taking place Bolt noted pdf p13 that he found “limited evidence of organisational learning or continuous improvement” in the way the Home Office dealt with private legal claims against it Relationships between departments dealing with legal claims were sometimes “ poor pdf p14 “ The number pdf p15 of asylum cases that went to appeal a ‘ Substantive Hearing ‘ and which the government then conceded “jumps significantly” in 201617 “No evidence” the Home Office is capable Overall Bolt was most critical of the Home Office’s ability to control its costs He said : In 201617… budgets were… significantly overspent which raised concerns about the Home Office’s ability to control its expenditure in this area The overall budget is planned to reduce substantially in 201920 which will require an exceptional level of cost saving efficiencies I found no evidence that would support such optimism But ultimately hexa0 concluded pdf p15 xa0that to reduce the number of people taking it to court and therefore its costs the government should improve its: initial decision making so that fewer individuals have cause to make a claim Bolt made seven recommendations pdf p16  all of which the government accepted  Whether its performance and its treatment of people wanting to live in the UK will improve remains to be seen Get Involved!

The small government agency creating a policy to stop botnets Getty Shaun Waterman Jan 30 2018 | CyberScoop When White House officials were drafting the cybersecurity executive order that President Donald Trump signed last May they faced a problem: Making the internet more secure against massive botnet attacks xa0 while taking coordinated action between a bewildering variety of stakeholders from a dozen different industries Action was essential: The threat from huge automated attacks — like the one that brought the stopped internet traffic it its tracks in October 2016 — was growing exponentially as the “Internet of Things” connected billions of insecure devices to the larger global network But forcing industry to act through regulation was off the table in an administration committed to cutting red tape Instead officials approached a small agency within the Commerce Department the National Telecommunications and Information Administration which was acquiring a reputation for addressing complex cybersecurity problems using a new model of policymaking NTIA’s multistakeholder process “was generating a lot of interest” early last year said Evelyn Remaley from the agency’s Office of Policy Analysis and Development “As the White House was building the executive order they talked to NTIA about ‘Is this open and transparent model that you’re using to bring industry and others together to do policymaking is it also something that we can look at for other areas in the cybersecurity space’” Remaley recalled In the end the section dedicated to botnets called for something verymuch like a multistakeholder process — and NTIA was assigned as the lead for the Commerce Department in convening it Earlier this month the agency published the first draft report developed in that process which called botnet resilience an “ecosystemwide” issue and urged action on several fronts including “globally accepted security standards and practices” for personal computers IoT equipment and other “edge devices” “These standards should be flexible appropriately timed open voluntary industrydriven and global in nature” the report adds mimicking the NTIA’s multistakeholder process it had produced in the past The White House’s interest in the new policy tool was sparked by NTIA’s work during the Obama administration on software vulnerability disclosure Remaley explained The process brings industry associations advocacy groups and subject matter experts together “in a nonregulatory way” she said “There’s no title of ‘chief glue maker’ but in some cases that’s really the role that we did play” Remaley said of the NTIA’s role as multistakeholder process convener “It’s a very useful way to develop policy when you find that there are parties that need to come to a consensus where you have very divergent viewpoints” This process considered by many cyberwatchers to be a useful alternative to conventional regulations which are too slow static and compliancebased to be useful in computer network security — where hacker adversaries are constantly innovating and evolving Remaley said it wasn’t just the NTIA’s role in developing the policy model that positioned it to lead the botnet resilience process She said that the relationships the agency had built in prior rounds of multistakeholder policymaking were also a factor “It was one of the reasons why … NTIA was also a main player in the botnet policy development process set in motion by the EO because of our relationships in building these processes with industry and civil society” she said Those relationships will be tested in the coming months as the rubber meets the road in the public consultation process on antibotnet resilience and the myriad of players involved — from device manufacturers software publishers and consumer internet service providers to major communications backbone companies — maneuver to reconcile potentially conflicting interests One issue that’s likely to cause some friction according to panelists at a recent US Telecom event  is the issue of smaller businesses which may lack the ability to implement best practices “We have a lot of smaller members” said Robert Mayer US Telecom’s senior vice president for cybersecurity “many of whom simply don’t have the resources” they would need to implement complex technical solutions “There need to be different expectations for smaller players versus the larger ones” agreed Chris Boyer assistant vice president of global public policy at AT&T and chairman of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee Remaley said NTIA was committed to involving what she called “the small players” in the process “It’s taken a little extra push but we’re committed to bringing them to the table” she said But her response also raises questions about how much of an improvement in internet resilience might emerge from the process “Because we’re looking to build some consensus around best practices sometimes they won’t be very deep” she acknowledged “We try to do it at that level where both big and small organizations can implement it right away” Boyer who led the drafting of a National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee report on the botnet issue that fed into the NTIA multistakeholder process was similarly modest about the policy objectives “A lot of the steps that we put in that report I would say are more incremental things They’re not gamechangers” he said “A lot of them are things that we know should be done they’re existing standards and we’re looking at ways we can raise the bar and get them more widely adopted and used” In this Story 
The State of Our Union: A House Divided Enslaved & Mired in the Mistakes of the Past By John W Whitehead January 29 2018 “ A house divided against itself cannot stand I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided It will become all one thing or all the other”—Abraham Lincoln History has a funny way of circling back on itself The facts figures faces and technology may change from era to era but the dangers remain the same This year is no different whatever the politicians and talking heads may say to the contrary Sure there’s a new guy in charge with a talent for stirring up mayhem and madness but for the most part we’re still recycling the same news stories that have kept us with one eye warily glued to the news for the past 100odd years: War Corruption Brutality Economic instability Partisan politics Militarism Disease Hunger Greed Violence Poverty Ignorance Hatred The more things change the more they stay the same Brush up on your history and you’ll find that we’ve been stuck on repeat for some time now Take the United States of America in the year 2018 which is not so far different from the United States of America during the Civil Rights era  or the Cold War era  or even the Depression era  Go far enough afield and you’ll find aspects of our troubled history mirrored in the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany in the fascism of Mussolini’s Italy and further back in the militarism of the Roman Empire  We’re like TV weatherman Phil Connors in Harold Ramis’ classic 1993 comedyxa0 Groundhog Day  forced to live the same day over and over again Here in the American police state however we continue to wake up hoping this new day new president and new year will somehow be different from what has come before Unfortunately no matter how we change the narrative change the characters change the plot lines we seem to keep ending up in the same place that we started: enslaved divided and repeating the mistakes of the past You want to know about the true State of our Union Listen up The State of the Union: The state of our union is politically polarized controlled by forces beyond the purview of the average American and rapidly moving the nation away from its freedom foundation Over the past year Americans have found themselves repeatedly subjected to egregious civil liberties violations invasive surveillance political correctness erosions of free speech strip searches police shootings of unarmed citizens government spying the criminalization of lawful activities warmongering etc The predators of the police state have wreaked havoc on our freedoms our communities and our lives The government has not listened to the citizenry refused to abide by the Constitution and treated the citizenry as the source of funding and little else Police officers shot unarmed citizens and their household pets Government agents—including local police—remain armed to the teeth and act like soldiers on a battlefield Bloated government agencies continue to fleece taxpayers Government technicians spy on our emails and phone calls And government contractors make a killing by waging endless wars abroad Consequently the state of our nation has become more bureaucratic more debtridden more violent more militarized more fascist more lawless more invasive more corrupt more untrustworthy more mired in war and more unresponsive to the wishes and needs of the electorate The policies of the American police state have continue d unabated The Executive Branch: All of the imperial powers amassed by Barack Obama and George W Bush —to kill American citizens without due process to detain suspects indefinitely to strip Americans of their citizenship rights to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause to suspend laws during wartime to disregard laws with which he might disagree to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts to sanction torture to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law to act as a dictator and a tyrant above the law and beyond any real accountability—were inherited by Donald Trump Trump has these powers because every successive occupant of the Oval Office has been allowed toxa0 expand the reach and power of the presidency through the use ofxa0 executive orders decrees memorandums proclamations national security directives and legislative signing statements xa0that can be activated by any sitting president Those of us who saw this eventuality coming have been warning for years about the growing danger of the Executive Branch with its presidential toolbox of terror that could be used—and abused—by future presidents The groundwork we warned  was being laid for a new kind of government where it won’t matter if you’re innocent or guilty whether you’re a threat to the nation or even if you’re a citizen What will matter is what the president—or whoever happens to be occupying the Oval Office at the time—thinks And if he or she thinks you’re a threat to the nation and should be locked up then you’ll be locked up with no access to the protections our Constitution provides In effect you will disappear Our warnings went unheeded The Legislative Branch: xa0Congress may well be the most selfserving semicorrupt institution in America Abuses of office runs the gamut from elected representatives neglecting their constituencies to engaging in selfserving practices including the misuse of eminent domain earmarking hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracting in return for personal gain and campaign contributions having inappropriate ties to lobbyist groups and incorrectly or incompletely disclosing financial information Pork barrel spending hastily passed legislation partisan bickering a skewed work ethic graft and moral turpitude have all contributed to the public’s increasing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership No wonder 84 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing The Judicial Branch: The Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds Yet through their deference to police power preference for security over freedom and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency the justices of the United States Supreme Court have become the guardians of the American police state in which we now live As a result sound judgment and justice have largely taken a back seat to legalism statism and elitism while preserving the rights of the people has been deprioritized and made to play second fiddle to both governmental and corporate interests The courts have empowered the government to wreak havoc on our liberties Protections for private property continue to be undermined And Americans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice Shadow Government: Donald Trump inherited more than a bitterly divided nation teetering on the brink of financial catastrophe when he assumed office He also inherited a shadow government one that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are in essence running the country Referred to as the Deep State thisxa0shadow government is comprised of unelected government bureaucrats corporations contractors paperpushers and buttonpushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes right now Law Enforcement: By and large the term “law enforcement” encompasses all agents within a militarized police state including the military local police and the various agencies such as the Secret Service FBI CIA NSA etc Having been given the green light to probe poke pinch taser search seize strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance all with the general blessing of the courts America’s law enforcement officials no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace but now extensions of the military are part of an elite ruling class dependent on keeping the masses corralled under control and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens As a result police are becoming even more militarized and weaponized and police shootings of unarmed individuals continue to increase A Suspect Surveillance Society: Every dystopian scifi film we’ve ever seen is suddenly converging into this present moment in a dangerous trifecta between science technology and a government that wants to be allseeing allknowing and allpowerful By tapping into your phone lines and cell phone communications thexa0 government knows what you say  By uploading all of your emails opening your mail and reading your Facebook posts andxa0 text messages  thexa0 government knows what you write  By monitoring your movements with the use of license plate readers surveillance cameras and other tracking devices thexa0 government knows where you go  By churning through all of the detritus of your life— what you read where you go what you say —thexa0 government can predict what you will do  By mapping the synapses in your brain scientists—and in turn the government— will soon know what you remember  And by accessing your DNA thexa0 government will soon know everything else about you that they don’t already know : your family chart your ancestry what you look like your health history your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course etc Consequently in the face ofxa0 DNA

The Tory MPs and donors taking in millions in housing benefit Currently wronged tenants must rely on councils to take action against bad landlords but many do not do so However even when landlords are successfully prosecuted some consider fines “part of the business model” Sir Robin Wales the leader of the London Borough of Newham told the Commons communities and local government committee on Monday “The problem is quite simply shocking” Wales told the MPs “Twentyfive people living in a threebedroom house is not unusual There was a guy on a raid I went on sleeping under the stairs Harry Potter had more room at the Dursleys’ house This is what our country is like in London and in other cities in the country” xa0Inside a rented house in Newham that was found to have category 1 hazards Photograph: Andrew BakerLondon Borough of Newham He is calling for councils to be given powers to confiscate property from rogue landlords On Mondayxa0 the Guardian reports on landlords who have been fined over £30000 by a magistrates court for multiple breaches of regulations  but are continuing to operate an unlicensed house of multiple occupation in Canning Town east London A spokesman for the Ministry ofxa0 Housing xa0said: “Everyone deserves a safe and decent home and we have given councils strong powers to crackdown on bad landlords and we expect them to use them We have brought in £30000 fines are introducing a database of bad landlords and given councils £12m to enforce the law in hotspot areas We are also supporting Karen Buck’s private member’s bill which will require all landlords ensure their properties are safe and give tenants the right to take legal action” Britain’s richest LandlordMP wants to gag press and prevent stories which might embarrass politicians Buck is axa0 Labour xa0backbencher whose housing fitness bill has become the focus of crossparty policy attempts to tackle the squalor problem The bill would give tenants the power to take landlords directly to court if they were renting homes in disrepair Although the government said it would back the bill in 2016 Javid and the current housing minister Dominic Raab were among 309 Conservative MPs who voted against an amendment to the housing and planning bill to “require that residential rented accommodation is provided and maintained in a state of fitness for human habitation” ‘I clean for Chelsea FC and live in squalor’: inside illegal housing The government said it would result in unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords pushing up rents It said local authorities already had strong and effective powers to deal with poor quality and unsafe accommodation Buck said she was pleased to have government backing “but I hope this will also mean finding time in the parliamentary schedule so we can get these measures passed into law as quickly as possible” Buck’s bill is also backed by the Residential Landlords Association which represents private landlords “The minority of landlords renting such homes are bringing the sector into disrepute and should be rooted out of the market for good” said Alan Ward its chairman “The cases raised in the Guardian show housing that is clearly not meeting the legal requirements “The question is what the councils are doing to take enforcement action against the landlords concerned In the end the problem is not about a lack of powers What is needed is a smarter system that frees up councils to better use their resources to root out the criminals”

Toggle Menu Intel reportedly notified Chinese companies of chip security flaw before the US government Intel is not having that great of year thus far in the face of a slew of information about security flaws in it hardware coming out — and you can add another new report from The Wall Street Journal today which suggests that Intel didn’t immediately notify the US government of the issues  to that list The Journal is reporting that Intel notified some of its customers of the security flaws in its processors dubbed Spectre and Meltdown but left out the US government as part of that Some of the companies Intel notified included Chinese technology companies though the report suggests there is no evidence that any information was misused An Intel spokesperson toldxa0The Journal that the company wasn’t able to tell everyone it planned because the news was made public earlier than expected The latter part of that is probably going to sting a little harderxa0because it would seem that Intel was going to give the US government little lead time ahead of disclosure of the flaw as security editor Zach Whittaker points out on Twitter : This is grade A crap Several people told me MeltdownSpectre’s planned disclosure was set for Jan 9 but was revealed on Jan 3 after a PoC came out Based on WSJ Intel was going to tell the US gov only a week before disclosure! It knew since June! https:tcoDLusu37zoL pictwittercom3s9COTub0C — Zack Whittaker @zackwhittaker January 28 2018 “The Google Project Zero team and impacted vendors including Intel followed best practices of responsible and coordinated disclosure” an Intel spokesperson said “Standard and wellestablished practice on initial disclosure is to work with industry participants to develop solutions and deploy fixes ahead of publication In this case news of the exploit was reported ahead of the industry coalition’s intended public disclosure date at which point Intel immediately engaged the US government and others” Intel has had to scramble to respond to the news which came out nearly a week earlier than expected Companies can notify some major customers and parties of flaws before they’re publicly disclosed so fixes and patches can come out and contain as much of the fallout as possible The Meltdown and Specter flaws were particularly hazardous because they theoretically can affect pretty much everyone xa0and the end result is a massive cleanup effort to make sure everything gets patched But because of the scale of the issue and Intel’s very precarious position of having to ensure as limited impact to its customers as possible it’s a very tricky situation to figure out who to inform and when in order to ensure everything gets resolved without the information becoming widespread and a source of additional risk for those customers Intel reported its fourthquarter earnings last week after which the stock jumped nearly 10% despite the news about Meltdown and Spectre continuing to trickle in “While we’ve made progress I am acutely aware that we have more to do” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the call to discuss its fourth quarter results “We’ve committed to being transparent keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and through our actions building trust Security is a top priority for Intel foundational to our products and it’s critical to the success of our datacentric strategy Our nearterm focus is on delivering highquality mitigations to protect our customers’ infrastructure on these exploits We’re working to incorporate siliconbased changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware and those products will begin appearing later this year However these circumstances are highly dynamic and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenges more broadly” Featured Image: Mandel NganGetty Images 
Top secret Australian government files found in secondhand shop Hundreds of documents were in filing cabinets bought for ‘small change’ because they had no key Wed 31 Jan 2018 0628xa0EST Last modified on Thu 1 Feb 2018 0135xa0EST Share on Messenger Close In a massive and highly embarrassing breach of national security hundreds of topsecret cabinet documents have been obtained by the ABC Photograph: AP Finding and exposing classified government information is a traditionally dangerous occupation – whistleblowers have risked their livelihoods and liberty to bring government secrets into the light while news organisations have been threatened and chastised But Australian journalists may have found a simpler way – scouring secondhand shops In a massive and highly embarrassing breach of national security hundreds of top secret cabinet documents have been obtained by the Australian broadcaster ABC after being found in two locked filing cabinets in a secondhand furniture store The Cabinet Files as the documents have been aptly named were found in the two filing cabinets sold at an exgovernment sale in Canberra – and were bought for “small change” because the keys to unlock them could not be found According to the ABC reporters Ashlynne McGhee and Michael McKinnon the filing cabinets had “sat unopened for some months until the locks were attacked with a drill” The documents which show the inner workings of five separate governments should have remained sealed for 20 years While Australians have been amused by the manner in which the documents came to light government officials are furious at the leak On Wednesday the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet PMC announced an urgent investigation Almost all of the files are classified some as “top secret” or “AUSTEO” which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only Terry Moran who was PMC secretary from 2008 to 2011 told ABC’s 730 the discovery was a “great surprise” and whoever was responsible for disposing of the cabinets “must be found and sacked” Moran said Australia’s system of government relied on ministers “being able to have very frank conversations” and public “insights into that free speech … would inhibit the sort of discussion that good decisionmaking … requires” The revelations include allegations that the Australian federal police lost nearly 400 national security files between 2008 and 2013 The documents lost by the AFP were from the cabinet’s national security committee which controls Australia’s security intelligence and defence agenda as well as deploying the military The documents also reveal that the former prime minister Tony Abbott’s government had considered denying welfare to people under 30 The options included cutting off under30s from income support entirely cutting off under30s in areas with employment opportunities and limiting income support to young people with a work history A report in the Cabinet Files also says the former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and two senior Labor ministers were warned about “critical risks” of a home insulation scheme before the deaths of four young installers  Rudd told the ABC any assertion he was warned about safety risks was untrue “The royal commission into the home insulation program had unprecedented access to cabinet material and made no adverse finding against Mr Rudd” he said in a statement The files also revealed that the former prime minister John Howard’s administration had debated removing the right of people to remain silent under police questioning after the wrongful arrest of the Indian doctor Mohammed Haneef on terrorism charges Topics 
Topsecret government files left in cabinets sold at secondhand shop By Kotgari News 0 Share Australian officials are investigating how topsecret documents were left in filing cabinets that were sold at a secondhand shop xa0Press24 News Filing cabinets containing thousands of classified documents from the Australian government ended up being sold at a secondhand shop prompting government officials Wednesday to launch an investigation into how the highly sensitive documents were disposed of The cache of documents was obtained by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which reported the two cabinets were sold by a Canberra furniture shop at a discount price because they were locked and no one could find keys The ABC described the incident as an “extraordinary breach of national security” and that nearly all the documents are classified with some documents being marked “top secret” “sensitive” “Australian eyes only” and “cabinetinconfidence” The stateowned broadcaster did not say when the documents known as the Cabinet Files were found or who the buyer was who removed the locks with a drill — but in recent weeks the outlet has reported stories on embarrassing moments during the tenures of former Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott Australia’s former Prime Minister Tony Abbott attends Britain’s annual Conservative Party Conference in 2016 xa0Press24 News The documents contain information detailing Australia’s intelligence priorities counterterrorism strategies missile upgrades and profiles of terror suspects that spans more than a decade and four prime ministers the most recent being Abbott Abbott was replaced in 2015 by current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull When questioned about the ABC’s reporting of Cabinet documents on Tuesday Turnbull told reporters: “I think they’ve come across someone’s bottom draw in Canberra” Sky News reported Some of the files reveal former finance minister Penny Wong left nearly 200 topsecret papers in her old office when her government was voted out in 2013 The documents included Middle East defense plans national security briefs and updates on the war in Afghanistan Australian Finance Minister Penny Wong speaks after a meeting between Finance Ministers of the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation xa0Press24 News EXNSA CONTRACTOR TO PLEAD GUILTY TO ‘BREATHTAKING’ HEIST OF TOPSECRET DATA The files also revealed that former Prime Minister John Howard’s National Security Committee at one point gave serious consideration to removing the right to remain silent to terrorism suspects when being questioned by police “I would also like NSC to consider whether amendments should be made to a suspect’s right to remain silent to allow a court to draw adverse inferences in a terrorism trial where an accused relies on evidence which he or she failed to mention when questioned by police” Ruddock wrote in his NSC submission obtained by the ABC The proposal was then supported by the Australian Federal Police and Australian Security Intelligence Organization but later rejected by the majority of the committee Another document reveals thatxa0AFP had lost almost 400 national security files over five years ending 2013 While the content of the missing security files was not revealed “troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq counterterrorism operations foreign relations and Australia’s border protection were among the topsecret and sensitive issues decided in the fiveyear period” according to the ABC Australian Cabinet documents are usually kept secret for 20 years before they are made public in a heavily redacted formxa0The sale of the exgovernment furniture in the country’s capital was not limited to Australians meaning anyone could make a purchase and could have handed the contents to a foreign agent or government The ABC said it chose to publish some of the files because “national security and the inner workings of our government affect the lives of all Australians” Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the ABC has “come across someone’s bottom draw in Canberra” xa0Press24 News The broadcaster said it had not chosen to report on some of the documents on national security grounds but said the leak shows the “casual attitude of some of those charged with keeping the documents safe” Rory Medcalf head of the Australian National University’s National Security College told the Associated Press the incident is “very weird and embarrassing” He added that while the US and other Aussie allies should be concerned the leak is not as damaging as prior ones “This is not catastrophically damaging for national security in the sense that that something like the Snowden revelations must have been” Medcalf told the AP referring to the former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden who disclosed classified information in 2013 The Associated Press contributed to this reportxa0 Travis Fedschun is a reporter for FoxNewscom Follow him on Twitter @travfed You Like this !

Trump is calling for an end to any semblance of independence for federal agencies Win McNameeGetty Images Donald Trump’s first State of the Union was a deeply dangerous speech It was deeply dangerous because he finally followed in the footsteps of European leaders like Hungarian President Viktor Orban who have long ago learned to give an attractive look to authoritarian populism Like them Trump eschewed openly racist remarks in his speech even emphasizing how much he supposedly cares about the fate of Latinos and black Americans Like them he called for economic policies like paid family leave that would actually benefit ordinary people And like them he then cast himself as the only man willing to prioritize the interests of his supporters over those of foreigners and political elites It was Bannonism without Bannon’s penchant for shock and awe And it played shockingly well But Trump’s speech was also deeply dangerous for an even more important reason: Under the cover of his soothing rhetoric about unity and bipartisanship Trump called on Congress to give him unprecedented and unquestionably antidemocratic powers: “Tonight” he said “I call on the congress to empower every Cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers—and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people” By design it is easy to overlook the true significance of the second half of that phrase But dwell on it for a moment and imagine what this would actually look like in practice Under Trump’s proposal any Cabinet secretary could decide that say a law enforcement official investigating the president had “undermined the public trust” or “failed the American people”—and fire him on the spot In other words Trump is calling for an end to any semblance of independence for the IRS the FBI the Department of Justice or any other federal agency To be sure such legislation is unlikely to pass xa0While the constant standing ovations for Trump from the Republican benches demonstrate the degree to which the GOP has now embraced the president they are not yet at the point of dismantling the rule of law quite so brazenly even if they did the Supreme Court would be very likely to strike such a law down as unconstitutional But the fact that Trump’s authoritarian demand is unlikely to be realized anytime soon does not make it unimportant In his first State of the Union the 45th president of the United States asked Congress for the authority to end the rule of law And that—not Trump’s supposedly unifying policy proposals much less his supposedly presidential ability to read a speech off a teleprompter—should be the headline of every newspaperxa0tomorrow Read more in Slate about the State of the Union One more thing You depend on Slate for sharp distinctive coverage of the latest developments in politics and culture Now we need to ask for your support Our work is more urgent than ever and is reaching more readers—but online advertising revenues don’t fully cover our costs and we don’t have print subscribers to help keep us afloat So we need your help If you think Slate’s work matters become a Slate Plus member You’ll get exclusive membersonly content and a suite of great benefits—and you’ll help secure Slate’s future

signs of child trafficking: Often children won’t be sure which country city or town they’re in They may be orphaned or living apart from their family in unregulated private foster care or in substandard accommodation They may possess unaccountedfor money or goods or repeatedly have new unexplained injuries National Crime Agency 313 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector harvesting grains or root vegetables tending livestock or fruit picking are being exploited every day in the UK Victims of this crime in the agricultural sector are often Eastern European men and women who were promised a job by traffickers or they could be individuals on the fringes of society homeless or destitute Through threats violence coercion or forced drug and alcohol dependency they’re enslaved working for little or no money living in squalid conditions having had their identity documents taken from them Spot the signs of exploitative labour in agriculture: Agricultural slaves often have their wages paid into the same bank account meaning an illegal gangmaster is likely collecting all their wages Exploited agriculture workers often don’t have suitable protective equipment working instead in cheap sports clothing and trainers and don’t have a different change of clothes from daytoday National Crime Agency 413 Food processing Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and after arrival gangmasters seize documents opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – but refuse to handover access to the accounts or bank cards Hours are long and the work is gruelling and dangerous Workers are abused and are controlled by threats of harm to their families at home Spot the signs: Those exploited wear inappropriate clothes and often no safety gear – despite working with dangerous and lifethreatening equipment They may often have untreated injuries and be refused medical attention and will live and work in agricultural outhouses National Crime Agency 513 Construction Labourintensive sectors like construction where temporary and irregular work are common are highrisk sectors for forced labour With new homes offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery after sexual exploitation Spot the signs of exploitative labour in construction: Exploited workers are often not provided with protective clothing or equipment and may show signs of abuse or carry old untreated injuries Slave workers are also likely to work extremely long work hours for six or seven days a week without any leave Photographer Rory Carnegie said: “I wanted this image to communicate that despite being forced to live eat wash and sleep – where they’re working in cramped and unhygienic conditions that there is a human instinct to domesticate I wanted to show how there is still hope and dignity in the most squalid and difficult of circumstances” Rory CarnegieNational Crime Agency 613 Maritime In the tough maritime industry young men often Filipino or Indian Eastern European or African are promised a better life but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation Unable to read they are offered a job given papers to sign and begin working on a trialbasis only to be told they have failed and owe money and have to work more to settle the debt They may be forced to work for long hours in intense hazardous and difficult conditions Photographer Rory Carnegie said: “In the 80s Chris Killip published a series of images called In Flagrante and these images were at the forefront of my mind while composing this shot I wanted to show the utter desperation of these men  how passed their limit they are The broken floats and the entire decaying environment around him I saw as a metaphor for his existence” Rory CarnegieNational Crime Agency 713 Forced prostitution Each year women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous individuals who befriend and then betray them women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced unpaid prostitution unable to escape Photographer Rory Carnegie said: “What I really wanted for this image was to depict how women are used as commodities the complete control slavery has over them – the helplessness of having to sit and wait for man after man until no more men arrive I wanted the image to show how lonely and eventually numbing that experience is and for that ugliness to be contrasted against the bright blue of the wig – a fancy dress item that we would usually associate with a fun event – but here is used as a disguise perhaps of her own identity to herself  to further emphasise how unjust the situation is” NCA 813 Cannabis farming The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where once in they won’t be able to leave Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses the boys are often locked in and forced to work sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape The eyes ears and compassion of the local community are essential Spot the signs: Aside from the strong and prolonged smell of cannabis have you noticed a house that looks unusual Are the windows covered or usual entry points blocked Buildings might be overheated – in very cold weather is the roof without frost because the house is being kept warm to grow plants National Crime Agency 913 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector harvesting grains or root vegetables tending livestock or fruit picking are being exploited every day in the UK Victims of this crime in the agricultural sector are often Eastern European men and women who were promised a job by traffickers or they could be individuals on the fringes of society homeless or destitute Through threats violence coercion or forced drug and alcohol dependency they’re enslaved working for little or no money living in squalid conditions having had their identity documents taken from them Spot the signs of exploitative labour in agriculture: Agricultural slaves often have their wages paid into the same bank account meaning an illegal gangmaster

launch its Social Credit System in 2020 The aim To judge the trustworthiness – or otherwise – of its 13 billion residents By Rachel Botsman Saturday 21 October 2017 On June 14 2014 the State Council of China published an ominoussounding document called Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System In the way of Chinese policy documents it was a lengthy and rather dry affair but it contained a radical idea What if there was a national trust score that rated the kind of citizen you were Imagine a world where many of your daily activities were constantly monitored and evaluated: what you buy at the shops and online where you are at any given time who your friends are and how you interact with them how many hours you spend watching content or playing video games and what bills and taxes you pay or not Its not hard to picture because most of that already happens thanks to all those datacollecting behemoths like Google Facebook and Instagram or healthtracking apps such as Fitbit But now imagine a system where all these behaviours are rated as either positive or negative and distilled into a single number according to rules set by the government That would create your Citizen Score and it would tell everyone whether or not you were trustworthy Plus your rating would be publicly ranked against that of the entire population and used to determine your eligibility for a mortgage or a job where your children can go to school  or even just your chances of getting a date A futuristic vision of Big Brother out of control No its already getting underway in China where the government is developing the Social Credit System SCS to rate the trustworthiness of its 13 billion citizens The Chinese government is pitching the system as a desirable way to measure and enhance trust nationwide and to build a culture of sincerity As the policy states It will forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs commercial sincerity social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility Advertisement Propaganda Chinas new viral app could be straight out of Black Mirror Others are less sanguine about its wider purpose It is very ambitious in both depth and scope including scrutinising individual behaviour and what books people are reading Its Amazons consumer tracking with an Orwellian political twist is how Johan Lagerkvist a Chinese internet specialist at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs described the social credit system Rogier Creemers a postdoctoral scholar specialising in Chinese law and governance at the Van Vollenhoven Institute at Leiden University who published a comprehensive translation of the plan compared it to Yelp reviews with the nanny state watching over your shoulder Read next Google’s nemesis: meet the British couple who took on a giant won and cost it £21 billion By Rowland Manthorpe For now technically participating in Chinas Citizen Scores is voluntary But by 2020 it will be mandatory The behaviour of every single citizen and legal person which includes every company or other entityin China will be rated and ranked whether they like it or not Kevin Hong Prior to its national rollout in 2020 the Chinese government is taking a watchandlearn approach In this marriage between communist oversight and capitalist cando the government has given a licence to eight private companies to come up with systems and algorithms for social credit scores Predictably data giants currently run two of the bestknown projects Advertisement The first is with China Rapid Finance a partner of the socialnetwork behemoth Tencent and developer of the messaging app WeChat with more than 850 million active users The other Sesame Credit is run by the Ant Financial Services Group AFSG an affiliate company of Alibaba Ant Financial sells insurance products and provides loans to small to mediumsized businesses However the real star of Ant is AliPay its payments arm that people use not only to buy things online but also for restaurants taxis school fees cinema tickets and even to transfer money to each other Sesame Credit has also teamed up with other datagenerating platforms such as Didi Chuxing the ridehailing company that was Ubers main competitor in China before it acquired the American companys Chinese operations in 2016 and Baihe the countrys largest online matchmaking service Its not hard to see how that all adds up to gargantuan amounts of big data that Sesame Credit can tap into to assess how people behave and rate them accordingly Read next From imitation to innovation: How China became a tech superpower By Christina Larson So just how are people rated Individuals on Sesame Credit are measured by a score ranging between 350 and 950 points Alibaba does not divulge the complex algorithm it uses to calculate the number but they do reveal the five factors taken into account The first is credit history For example does the citizen pay their electricity or phone bill on time Next is fulfilment capacity which it defines in its guidelines as a users ability to fulfil hisher contract obligations The third factor is personal characteristics verifying personal information such as someones mobile phone number and address But the fourth category behaviour and preference is where it gets interesting Under this system something as innocuous as a persons shopping habits become a measure of character Alibaba admits it judges people by the types of products they buy Someone who plays video games for ten hours a day for example would be considered an idle person says Li Yingyun Sesames Technology Director Someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility So the system not only investigates behaviour  it shapes it It nudges citizens away from purchases and behaviours the government does not like Advertisement Friends matter too The fifth category is interpersonal relationships What does their choice of online friends and their interactions say about the person being assessed Sharing what Sesame Credit refers to as positive energy online nice messages about the government or how well the countrys economy is doing will make your score go up Alibaba is adamant that currently anything negative posted on social media does not affect scores we dont know if this is true or not because the algorithm is secret But you can see how this might play out when the governments own citizen score system officially launches in 2020 Even though there is no suggestion yet that any of the eight private companies involved in the ongoing pilot scheme will be ultimately responsible for running the governments own system its hard to believe that the government will not want to extract the maximum amount of data for its SCS from the pilots If that happens and continues as the new normal under the governments own SCS it will result in private platforms acting essentially as spy agencies for the government They may have no choice Posting dissenting political opinions or links mentioning Tiananmen Square has never been wise in China but now it could directly hurt a citizens rating But heres the real kicker: a persons own score will also be affected by what their online friends say and do beyond their own contact with them If someone they are connected to online posts a negative comment their own score will also be dragged down Read next Didi Chuxing took on Uber and won Now its taking on the world By James Crabtree So why have millions of people already signed up to what amounts to a trial run for a publicly endorsed government surveillance system There may be darker unstated reasons  fear of reprisals for instance for those who dont put their hand up  but there is also a lure in the form of rewards and special privileges for those citizens who prove themselves to be trustworthy on Sesame Credit If their score reaches 600 they can take out a Just Spend loan of up to 5000 yuan around £565 to use to shop

Why the Argentinian government introduced vegan Mondays Chef Dante Liporace at the Casa Rosada Can the worlds second most carnivorous country embrace a plantbased diet Sorrel MoseleyWilliams visits a government leading from the top Monday 22 January 2018 10:05 GMT Click to follow The Independent Travel There was an uproar at the Casa Rosada in July 2017 the day chef Dante Liporace introduced a vegan menu to the staff canteen Some stormed off to McDonald’s to buy burgers then posted selfies of them eating them inside the Argentinian presidential palace in defiant protest The number of staffers dining inhouse slumped by 93 per centxa0 Liporace was not surprised “Lunesxa0Vegano” or MeatFree Monday was always going to be controversial in a country which per capita is second only to Uruguay for its beef consumption Launching it at the heart of government was even more so Read more Spend the perfect weekend in Buenos Aires Many steakloving civil servants found it hard to stomach Liporace initiating such a move Confused too – because in Buenos Aires the chef is known for creating the “Sequence of the Cow” headtotail tasting menu that includes brain and oxtail But it wasn’t down to him In June Fernando de Andreis – General Secretary of the Presidency of the Nation working under President Mauricio Macri – suggested that in a bid to eat more healthily staff at the Casa Rosada should try having vegan Mondays Where better place to start practising what you preach than at the heart of government He asked Liporace to put together a threemonth trial runxa0 This is the second culinary shakeup Liporace has been involved with since he took over the reins at Government House’s kitchen two years ago The initial challenge was getting the canteen – whose subsidised daily meals used to be served on prison slop trays for a piffling AR$3 pesos 13p – up to scratch and turning a profit That move was a success: three months in the canteen had gone from serving around 50 meals a day to dishing up more than 600 at a more reasonable AR$65 pesos £286 each He was also including daily vegetarian and glutenfree options The idea to go vegan came from the top of the Argentinian government Fernando de Andreis But it’s one thing to add a vegetarian option and quite another to make the menu vegan once a week Especially in a country where the average inhabitant devours 57 kilos of beef per year “I got the call to start making healthier dishes once a week so I looked into creating a 100 per cent organic menu” Liporace tells The Independent “But it simply wasn’t costeffective So from one day to the next it was decided to make the Monday menu totally vegan That way people didn’t have the chance to say ‘I won’t go for the vegan option today’” That first Lunes Vegano didn’t go so well – a mere 40 diners turned up instead of the usual 600 Liporace had sprung it on the employees without priming them in advance Instead he let a blackboard do the talking with statements chalked on it: “It will improve your health it challenges you to do something different it’s good for the planet” surrounded by arty drawings of aubergine leeks and corn on the cob It was a shock to the system – and possibly the worst way for politicians and civil servants to start the working week xa0 “That first day was terrible” says Liporace “All three options were vegan and all anyone wanted was meat I got loads of abuse for it People don’t realise that they miss meat until you don’t offer it to them” After forcing the issue for three consecutive Mondays he relented ditching the forced veganism and including a plantbased dish alongside meatier options Reverse psychology it turned out was the way forward By the fourth week 250 people picked the vegan dish even against more traditional options “People have got used to it quite quickly” he says The staff’s favourite meal: polenta with mushroom lentil and hazelnut ragout Sorrel MoseleyWilliams Besides convincing his diners including ministers and visiting dignitaries to give into veggies and pulses once a week it’s been a challenge for the El Bullitrained chef to come up with creative – and tasty – fare “The hardest part has been replacing dairy products in desserts” he says “My team has also had to get used to working with tofu which many of them have never cooked with before”xa0 The threemonth trial did so well that now the Casa Rosada is planning to bring Lunesxa0Vegano back on a permanent basis this year They’ve tried plenty of dishes so far – a tofu and vegetable tart a nut risotto But says Liporace the most popular one to date has been polenta with mushroom lentil and hazelnut ragout Analia a waitress at the Casa Rosada agrees: “I really liked the polenta It’s my favourite so far” she says enthusiastically As for the man in whose name this initiative was created President Macri himself hasxa0ordered from the veganxa0menu says Liporace He’s a fan of the cheesefree aubergine “parmigiana” and loves the chef’s take on gazpacho – a tomato and green apple soup Whichxa0isxa0even without the Meatfree Monday designationxa0veganxa0 Travel essentials Getting there Journey Latin

William Nardi  University of Massachusetts Boston •January 31 2018 In an effort to support illegal immigrants enrolled at UCLA its student government recently allocated $100000 to help fund the public university’s Undocumented Student Program “It goes to the UCLA Undocumented Student Program to help retain undocumented students at UCLA” Financial Support Commissioner Aaron Boudaie told The College Fix via email The Undocumented Student Program at UCLA offers academic advising counseling legal advice DACA workshops scholarship information and more according to its website Each quarter the group also hosts an “UndocuALLY” training a fourhour workshop on the “history legislation and experiences of undocumented students in higher education” The money came from the student government’s “student fees surplus” according to students who led the effort to secure the funding allocation in a letter to the editor of the Daily Bruin The student government currently has a large influx of cash in its surplus coffers due to an accounting error and its leaders chose to give a huge chunk of that money to undocumented students the Bruin reported  “UCLA accounting services neglected to allocate $461662 in funding from three years …” it reported “USAC can now use $149770 of the surplus which is the amount that should have been allocated to student group funds in previous years … Following lobbying by undocumented student groups the council unanimously voted Tuesday to allocate $100000 of the surplus funds to the UCLA Undocumented Student Program which provides resources for undocumented students on campus” Student government leaders did not respond to an interview request from The College Fix to ask about more details regarding that decision such as whether other campus groups were considered Student government leaders are also hosting a town hall to discuss how to spend the rest of the surplus In their letter to the editor students called on campus leaders to also support undocumented students “Although the administration may hesitate to put its own dollars into action our success in advocating for the allocation of the USAC surplus to USP shows the student body cares deeply about this pressing issue and we can make a tangible difference on campus” the letter stated Since last fall they’ve lobbied with the Financial Aid Student Affairs and Campus Life departments to secure further institutional support for undocumented immigrants according to their letter “While our nation’s politics around immigration remain chaotic we believe UCLA is in a position to exemplify its ‘Principles of Community’ and institutionalize financial support for this marginalized student population” it states “UCLA has a unique opportunity to be a national leader in efforts to defend and support undocumented students As students we have put our money where our mouths are The UCLA administration should do the same and help us institutionalize these efforts moving forward” they wrote Last March more than 1300 students and dozens of professors signed a petition to offer UCLA as a sanctuary campus against the “aggressive and punitive measures” by President Trump Their efforts culminated in a town hall event attended by over 150 students labor union and grassroots organizers to affirm their support for undocumented immigrants the Daily Bruin reported  “Sanctuary cities are important to drive out the TrumpPence fascist regime” then fourthyear Geography student Tala Deloria had said In 2016 at UCLA when the Bruin Republicans hosted an event called “An Illegal Immigrant Killed My Child” it was crashed by protestors furious over the topic In 2013 UCLA’s student government also banned the term “illegal immigrant” calling it derogatory

World Women in Iran remove hijabs in public to protest country’s Islamic dress code The protests still small in number are significant as a rare public sign that dissatisfaction with certain Islamic laws governing personal conduct may have reached a boiling point This Twitter photo shared by user @MaajidNawaz on Jan 29 2018 shows a woman in Iran holding her hijab on a stick in protestxa0xa0Twitter@MaajidNawazxa0xa0 By THOMAS ERDBRINKThe New York Times Mon Jan 29 2018 TEHRAN—Climbing atop a 5foottall utility box in one of Tehran’s busiest squares Monday an Iranian woman removed her head scarf tied it to a stick and waved it for all to see It was no small feat in Iran where women can be arrested for publicly flouting the Islamic requirement that they cover their hair But there she stood her curly hair blowing in the breeze No one protested In fact she was applauded by many people Taxi drivers and older women took her picture Police who maintain a booth in the square either did not see her or decided not to intervene “My hands were trembling the 28yearold said asking not to be named out of fear of arrest “I was anxious and feeling powerful at the same time And proud I felt proud” She was not alone On Monday several other women a total of six according to social media accounts made the same symbolic gesture: taking off their head scarves in public and waving them on a stick emulating a young woman who climbed on the same sort of utility box on Dec 27 and was subsequently arrested Activists say she has since been released but she still has not resurfaced in public Article Continued Below At least one of the women protesting Monday was arrested by police a shopkeeper who witnessed the arrest said The protests still small in number are nevertheless significant as a rare public sign that dissatisfaction with certain Islamic laws governing personal conduct may have reached a boiling point As the 28yearold woman said “I took my scarf off because I’m tired of our government telling me what to do with my body” And some said this might just be the beginning “My guess is that more of these protests will follow” said Nasrin Sotoudeh a lawyer and human rights activist “It’s obvious that some women want to decide for themselves what to wear” That remains to be seen but the protests have already gained enough attention to provoke angry reactions in some quarters “These protests are done by instigators saboteurs and vandalists and anarchists” said one critic Kazem Anbarlooie editorinchief of the hardline newspaper Resalat “Recently our enemies were communists and liberals now Americans are provoking masochists against us” The first protest in December took place on a Wednesday and seemed connected to the White Wednesday campaign an initiative by Masih Alinejad an exiled Iranian journalist and activist living in the United States Alinejad has reached out to Iranian women on Persianlanguage satellite television and through social media and via a website she runs called My Stealthy Freedom On the website women post images of themselves without head scarves demanding an end to the compulsory head scarf law During Monday’s protests some women waved white scarves the symbol of Alinejad’s campaign Hardliners say that foreign intelligence agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency have been nurturing protests in Iran like those that broke out in 80 cities at end of last year Nearly 4000 people were arrested and 25 died according to official statistics The hardliners have not provided proof to back up their claims The Islamic head scarf or hijab is seen by Iranian ideologues as a pillar of the Islamic Republic of Iran The law regarding the scarf has been enforced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and a head scarf is obligatory for every woman in the country even tourists and visiting foreign dignitaries While discriminatory Islamic divorce and inheritance laws pose problems for individual women the head scarf is a highly public symbol of a set of personal rules imposed by Iran’s clerical leaders who decide what people can wear what music they can listen to and what television programs and movies they get to see Men are also the subject of clothing laws: They are forbidden to wear shorts in public During the past decade influenced by the rise of the internet satellite television and cheap foreign travel many Iranians have grown deeply resentful of rules that they can see for themselves are out of step with most of the rest of the world Many have become relatively secular and feel increasingly unwelcome in the fixedinstone state version of Shiite Islam and many have taken to flouting the rules whenever and wherever they feel free enough to do so In past years the morality police zealously enforced the rules arresting women and men who violated them But under the current president Hassan Rouhani a moderate those officers have largely been taken off the streets Their removal was a gesture to a radically changed society but it was also a recognition that there were not enough enforcers available to control a society that resents and rejects the rules Women without head scarves can been seen everywhere in Tehran in their cars in shopping centres and even on the street but always with the scarves draped over their shoulders as if they have only just slipped off But the public protests are different because they are a symbolic rejection of authority and a statement that some young women are apparently ready to emulate “I was working when I saw the image of another woman protesting on social media” the 28yearold said in a telephone interview She said she informed some friends and coworkers about her intentions “If a lot of people do this it will have more influence I thought so I went” she said At Ferdowsi Square one of the busiest places in Tehran she used a tree branch to clamber on top of the utility box next to a traffic light “’Good going’” she said many people shouted “After five or six minutes people urged me to step down” They did not have a problem with her protest she said but they had what they wanted “They had taken enough pictures to put on social media” she said Read more about:

of the Constitutional Court whose tenure has ended – Seven measures in the sections Civil Society Reforms of the Judiciary Fight against Organized Crime and Corruption and Migrations are convoluted processes which in order to have real and positive effect on the long run must not be implemented by skipping steps: Civil society 7 Establishing functional Council for Cooperation between the

trafficking and smuggling immigrants composed of representatives of the Basic Public Prosecutor’s Office for Fight against Organized Crime and Corruption and the Ministry of Interior xa0 ANALYSTS: THERE IS PROGRESS BUT THINGS SHOULD BE SPEEDED UP In spite of the government’s assessments that all measures under its competence have been implemented whereas the ones under the competence of other institutions have been delayed the political analyst professor Jove Kekenovski believes that “despite the certain progress regarding the implementation of the Plan 369 some inconsistencies and lagged steps ought to be pointed out” In regard to the local elections Kekenovski notes that the SEC failed to fully consolidate the Voter List The suspicions and remarks by OSCEODIHR noted in the Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions referring to the separation of the state and the party isolated cases of abuse of administrative resources vote buying taking photos of ballots and family voting are unfavorable The politicization of members of SEC existed during these elections as well therefore new and depoliticized composition of SEC is urgently required In terms of the Parliament’s work he stresses that “there is still lack of constructive dialogue between the position and opposition thus the scrutiny of the Parliament and the parliamentary bodies over the work of the government and security and intelligence services thereof is absent The scrutiny is still far away from becoming regular routine involving the highest possible level of transparency and participation of civil society representatives The achieved so far resembles declarative pledge instead of real control Thematic MP’s questions still haven’t been introduced as laid down in the plan and the Standing Inquiry Committee for Protection of Civil Freedoms and Rights hasn’t been reactivated A member of the Council of Public Prosecutors upon the Parliament’s proposal still hasn’t been elected With regard to the cohabitation with the President of the state Kekenovski says that there is no progress at all and it can be freely stated that nothing has moved from a standstill It is really unfortunate that the President the Government and the Parliament still cannot agree upon the election of judges of the Constitutional Court although three vacancies are available at the Constitutional Court Consultations for occupying the free positions in the diplomatic representations with the President of the Republic of Macedonia might have begun but no effect is evident Party personnel instead of professionals is again in play Concerning the Ohrid Framework Agreement the proposed Law on the Use of the Languages goes beyond the frameworks of the Agreement itself according to Kekenovski Regarding the media and the public administration reform he believes that there is little insufficient and expected progress It’s encouraging to know that the administration slowly gets rid of the party fetters while the media get rid of the past influence of the current opposition party However due to certain occurrences during the local elections I wouldn’t be surprised if some media and journalists are put in favor of the ruling parties regardless of all professional and ethical standards Kekenovski thinks there is some progress regarding the reforms of the judiciary specifically referring to the encouragement of judges for free and impartial and righteous trial But as he puts it: The inept and partyinfluenced Judicial Council is the stumbling block as well as the obstructions made by high courtparty officials who should’ve already been removed from their offices Kekenovski believes that the beginning of the reform of the intelligence and security services is lagging behind although they should’ve been of highest priority besides the judiciary and the media The commission for reforms of these structures has been formed just a few days ago The government should start practicing the pledge against organized crime and corruption which seems that is still on paper Invoking on the monitoring conducted by the nongovernmental Institute for Democracy Societas Civilis Alsat M TV informed on 7 November 2017 that “one third of the activities in the section ‘3’ of the government’s Plan 369 hasn’t been implemented and some of them are being implemented behind time”: At this moment given the dynamics things are tardy The implementation result of the activities set forth in section three from the Plan 369 is behind schedule and the activities that are supposed to be encompassed in section six and section nine are yet to be determined said Zoran Nechev – Institute for Democracy Societas Civilis xa0 This article was created within the framework  of the Project to increase the

xa0 TOP The Trump administration has made serving our nation’s veterans and reforming the broken Department of Veterans Affairs VA a priority and has given the VA the tools it needs to do so So why the hell is the VA still torturing puppies in useless lab experiments Since taking office President Trump has signed a remarkable 10 major pieces of VA reform legislation into law to strengthen the veterans’ health care system improve benefits and provide exceptional support for these brave men and women who’ve been neglected for too long Yet despite the President’s campaign promises and his leadership in the Oval Office the VA has yet to resolve one of its most highprofile—and easily fixable—controversies: its wanton abuse of man’s best friend The VA has been rightfully slammed by veterans Congress and countless Americans for continuing to torture dogs in its research labs VA staff are giving dogs heart attacks injecting them with meth drilling into their skulls collapsing their lungs and committing other unspeakable abuses against puppies as young as 5monthsold This disgusts me as an American taxpayer and doglover Veterans organizations across the country have rallied around this cause citing it as another example of the VA’s misplaced prioritiesxa0 Veterans are dying because they can’t get a doctor’s appointment are enduring botched medical procedures by incompetent VA staff are being denied medical benefits and are committing suicide because they’ve been neglected by the system Yet the VA has continued to waste time money and other resources on bizarre outdated and unnecessary dog research that hasn’t produced useful results and that most veterans opposexa0 Its infuriating that the VA is ardently defending this useless junk science but refusing to study the many proven benefits of medical marijuana for alleviating veterans’ PTSD and chronic pain My friend Congressman Brian Mast RFL a Purple Heart recipient who lost both legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan put it best when he recently saidxa0“As a combatwounded veteran its alarming that the VA is spending taxpayers’ money abusing dogs in unnecessary experiments when veterans are still unable to get the treatment and care they need” The House of Representatives unanimously passed legislation cosponsored by Rep Mast to cut the funding for the VA’s devilish dog researchxa0 The Senate has yet to act but solving this problem is simple and is not dependent upon an act of Congress VA Secretary David Shulkin can literally end this boondoggle overnight President Trump has made clear that he wants the VA cleaned up and that he won’t tolerate animal abuse He recently called elephant hunting a “horror show” and took bold and decisive action to halt the Interior Department’s misguided plans to allow African biggame “trophies” to be imported in the US The VA’s dog testing is another horror show that needs to end Neglecting veterans’ needs and abusing man’s best friend with taxpayers’ money is positively unAmerican I call on President Trump to end this wasteful and inhumane madness immediately All it takes is the stroke of a pen Rogerxa0Stonexa0is a legendary Republican political consultant and a veteran of many national Republican presidential campaigns The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller
