Thesis: Supporting Big Data at the Vehicular Edge
Abstract:
Vehicle networks are common place and many applications have been developed to utilize their sensor
and computing resources. This is a great utilization of these resources as long as they are mobile. The
question to ask is whether these resources could be put to use when the vehicle is not mobile. If the
vehicle is parked, the resources are simply dormant and waiting for use. If the vehicle has a connection to
a larger computing infrastructure, then it can put its resources towards that infrastructure. With enough
vehicles interconnected, there exists a computing environment that could handle many cloud-based
application services. If these vehicles were electric, then they could in return receive electrical charging
services.
This thesis will investigate the use of parked vehicles to form a datacenter infrastructure for supporting Big
Data processing. This discussion will provide a baseline for this computing infrastructure, and the basis for
further investigation on the use of these untapped resources.
