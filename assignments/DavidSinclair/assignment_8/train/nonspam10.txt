Weaponized Web Archives: Provenance Laundering of Short Order Evidence
Dr. Michael Nelson,
ODU Dept of Computer Science
Abstract
We are on the cusp of a "photoshop" moment in our ability to produce convincing synthetic audio and video
content, adding a new dimension to the existing problem of text- and image-based “fake news”. Social
media and the web and will be the primary vector for the spread of this disinformation, and soon web
archives will be “weaponized” to 1) alter existing trustworthy sources, and 2) obfuscate the provenance of
untrustworthy sources. As web archives increasingly become a source of evidence in political and cultural
discourse, they will attract the attention of those who would seek to alter the historical record. We review
the broader context of threats and opportunities, and then present one solution the Web Science and
Digital Libraries group is working on to authenticate the integrity of web archives.
