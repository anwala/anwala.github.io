Greetings!
You are being asked to complete a survey for research on personality traits and the use of self-regulated
learning strategies among graduate students. The purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of
the possible relationship between personality and self-regulated strategy use. Your participation in this study
involves considering your study habits in order to rate your use of various self-regulation strategies, reflecting
on your attitudes and behaviors in order to identify common personality tendencies, and completing a
73-item survey. The survey will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. Responses are confidential
and will only be reported in aggregate. Upon completion of the survey, you will have the opportunity to enter
into a random drawing for one of ten $5 Amazon gift cards.
