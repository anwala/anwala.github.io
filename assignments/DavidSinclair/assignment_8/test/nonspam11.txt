Modified Sexual Behavior and
Education Survey
Dear Prospective Survey Participant,
I am a doctoral student from Walden University, and I am conducting a pilot study before the final
study can be done as part of my doctoral degree requirements. My study is entitled, Examining
Relationships Between Sexual Education and Behaviors Among Virginia College Students. This is a
letter of invitation to participate in this pilot study. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if the
survey instrument valid enough to measure the relationship between student exposure of health
promoting sexual education and their current sexual practices. The study could help public health
professionals assess how studentâ€™s past sexual education, regarding healthy sexual behaviors and
STI knowledge, is associated with their current personal sexual behaviors. Conducting this pilot
study will highlight if the proposed survey questions are adequate enough to measure the variables
relationship or are additional questions needed.
By agreeing to participate in the pilot study, you will be giving your consent for the researcher or
principal investigator to include your responses in her data analysis. Your participation in this pilot
study is strictly voluntary, and you may choose not to participate without fear of penalty or any
negative consequences.
A link to the informed consent agreement will appear at the bottom of this email and after consent is
given the next screen will consist of the survey. There will be no individually identifiable information,
remarks, comments or other identification of you as an individual participant. All results will be
presented as aggregate, summary data. If you wish, you may request a copy of the results of this
research study by writing to the researcher at: Dyani.meggett-sowell@waldenu.edu
The survey will last no more than 5 minutes. Your participation will contribute to the current literature
on the subject of sexual education and behaviors. No compensation will be offered for your
participation.
If you have any questions related to this study, please contact the researcher by sending your
questions to Dyani.meggett-sowell@waldenu.edu or irb@waldenu.edu If you decide to participate
