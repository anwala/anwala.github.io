Grad Students,
Registration for the Fall 2018 semester begins on April 2 for returning students.
The Fall graduate course schedule (with additional information about some of the *95 courses) is available
at https://graduate.cs.odu.edu/resources/fall-2018-sched/
The full, daily-updated schedule with enrollments and room numbers is at http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/
courseSchedule/viewer.php?semester=fall18
Note that we are in the process of hiring new faculty members who would be starting in the Fall and likely
offer additional 795/895 courses.
It is good to register early, but do not over-register. Students who register for 12 credit hours with the
intention of keeping only 9 credit hours will have a hold placed on their account.
If you are a PhD student, consult with your PhD advisor regarding courses and to have your advising hold
(or degree plan hold) cleared.
If you are a MS student and have an advising hold (or degree plan hold), see below:
From your ODU email account, send me (mweigle@cs.odu.edu) an email with the following information:
* Name
* UIN
* prerequisites required, if any
* planned courses to take in Fall 2018
If I have enough information to clear your advising hold without an in-person meeting, Iâ€™ll send you an email
when that has been done.
For those of you who wish to have an in-person meeting or have questions about courses, my regular
office hours are Tuesdays 1-2pm and Thursdays 2-3pm. You do not need to make an appointment to meet
with me during those times.
