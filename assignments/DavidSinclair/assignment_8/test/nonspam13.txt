BEFORE PREREGISTRATION BEGINS
Check for Holds: See “My Status Alerts” at my.odu.edu.
Advising: Be sure your advisor has moved your degree-planning hold to
a future date so you can preregister on time. Your advisor can also view
your time ticket on myODU during your meeting.
Once pre-registration begins, register as soon as your time ticket permits!
Please let us know if there is anything our office can do to assist you as you pursue your
studies at the University.
Sincerely,
Registration Team
