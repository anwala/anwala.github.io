Just one last friendly reminder about Kimberly Bryant, Founder of Black Girls CODE's upcoming talk o n March 29,
from 7-9 PM in the Big Blue Room at the Ted Constant Convoca�on Center. Her talk is �tled, "The Rising Tide of
Diversity in Tech," and it explores the need to create more pathways for girls of color to become leaders and
innovators in STEAM fields.
I would appreciate your sharing informa�on with students in your classes.
Black Girls CODE is a non-profit organiza�on dedicated to introducing girls of color to the fields of technology and
computer science with a concentra�on on entrepreneurial concepts. Since 2011, Ms. Bryant has helped Black Girls
CODE grow from a local organiza�on in the San Francisco Bay Area to an interna�onal organiza�on with chapters
across the United States and in Johannesburg, South Africa.
She has earned a reputa�on as a thought leader in the area of tech inclusion and has spoken on the topic at
events such as TEDx Kansas City, Big Ideas Fes�val and SXSW. Bryant has received many honors, including the
American Ingenuity Award in Social Progress from the Smithsonian and a Champion of Change designa�on from
